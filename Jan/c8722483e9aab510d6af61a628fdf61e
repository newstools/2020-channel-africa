Romero, 32, was seen in images posted on social media standing next to the car which was wedged underneath a roadside crash barrier close to United's Carrington training ground. The Manchester Evening News cited a club source as saying Romero was involved in the crash but did not suffer any injuries. Sky Sports reported the Argentina international was even able to take a normal part in training on Monday. Romero signed for United in 2015, but has made just 53 appearances as he has largely been second choice behind David de Gea.
