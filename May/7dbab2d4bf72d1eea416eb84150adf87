DRC football federation, Fecofa, issued a statement saying they reached their decision following a meeting on Wednesday after the 2019/20 season had been halted by the Covid-19 crisis. TP Mazembe, who were leading the standings before play stopped, are "crowned champions" with AS Vita Club named as runners-up, the statement said. Fecofa confirmed that the last two teams in the standings, OC Bukavu Dava and AS Nyuki, have been relegated to division two with JSK and Etoile Jaune gaining promotion through two of the regional leagues. --BBC--
