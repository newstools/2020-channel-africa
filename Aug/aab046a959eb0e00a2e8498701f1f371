Production is expected to start next year building up to 150 000 future Mazda crossover vehicles and 150 000 Toyota sport utility vehicles annually. The Japanese automakers are expected to receive $97 million in additional tax incentives for the added investment, a person briefed on the matter said. The automakers have faced challenges as they continued construction work during the coronavirus pandemic on the plant, which will now cost about 50% more than first estimated. The companies said the higher investment “accommodates production line enhancements made to improve manufacturing processes.” The plant continues to target up to 4000 new jobs and has hired approximately 600 employees to date. “Mazda and Toyota’s increased commitment to the development of this manufacturing plant reiterates their belief in the future of manufacturing in America and the potential for the state of Alabama to be an economic leader in the wake of unprecedented economic change,” Alabama Governor Kay Ivey said in a statement. The companies said the plant’s roofing, siding, floor slabs, ductwork, fire protection and electrical work is 75% to 100% complete. --Reuters--
