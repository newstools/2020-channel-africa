Correspondents say the move is likely to provoke anger amongst the emir's huge number of followers in the mostly Muslim north of Nigeria. A controversial former bank chief, he came to the emir's throne in 2014 after exposing massive corruption in the oil sector. The BBC's Ishaq Khalid in Nigeria says while the sacking has shocked many Nigerians, to those in the northern state of Kano it is not a surprise. Since 2017 relations between the emir and the current Kano Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje, have been strained. Supporters of the governor believed the emir had opposed his re-election last year. After the 2019 election, the governor split the Kano emirate into five and appointed four more emirs, to weaken Sanusiâ€™s influence. Sanusi has not yet commented on his removal, and his replacement has not been announced yet. Traditional leaders hold few constitutional powers but are able to exert significant influence as they are seen as custodians of both religion and tradition. --BBC--
