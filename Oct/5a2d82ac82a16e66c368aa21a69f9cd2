Some 23 travellers were arrested on Sunday while checking in at Entebbe International airport near the capital, Kampala, while two others were apprehended on arrival. The Uganda Civil Aviation Authority spokesperson, Vianney Luggya, said the suspects are being held by aviation police. They will face charges of forgery and uttering of false documents. Uganda reopened its international borders on October 1, six months after they were closed to slow the spread of coronavirus. It now requires departing travellers to present negative test results taken 120 hours before leaving. Arriving passengers have to present certificates of test results taken within 72 hours before their flight. The East Africa country has so far confirmed 10,590 coronavirus cases and 97 deaths from about half a million tests carried out. About eight facilities are accredited to run Covid-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) tests but they are costly. Some facilities charge as much as $126 for each test.  --BBC--
