About 200 000 have been left homeless by the floods which have swept through at least five of Ethiopia's 10 regions, he added. The floods have killed livestock, destroyed crops and damaged homes and public infrastructure to an extent not seen in decades.

It has been caused by higher than usual seasonal rains, and the levels of the River Nile have been at their highest in a century. --BBC--
