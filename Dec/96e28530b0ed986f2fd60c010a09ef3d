Nearly three quarters of Kenya’s intensive care unit (ICU) beds are in the two largest cities, Nairobi and Mombasa. Yet the new coronavirus is spreading into rural areas where the public health system is creaking and scarce ICU units are full and turning patients away, medics round the nation told Reuters. Christmas travel may worsen the problem - and not just in Kenya. “That is our biggest fear now,” said John Nkengasong, head of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, a branch of the African Union bloc. “During the holiday season, there will be a tendency for large movement from capital cities to villages, remote areas, for people to connect with families. That might drive the pandemic,” he told a news conference from Ethiopia this week. Africa is recording 10,000-12 000 cases daily, moving toward a July peak of 14 000, after most governments eased lockdowns that curbed the disease but decimated jobs. After measures were softened, Kenya had record daily cases and deaths in November, taking the totals to nearly 90 000 infections and 1 500 fatalities here. Experts say the real tally is much higher due to inadequate testing and a policy of only counting hospital deaths. One of those was Justus Murunga, a member of parliament who died on November 14 after developing breathing problems on a visit to his rural home in the Kagamega area of rural west Kenya. When he arrived at the nearest public hospital, he was turned away because there was no oxygen.
