Some 20 Ugandan nationals detained in Rwanda were released on Wednesday, a day after Uganda released 13 Rwandan nationals it had detained on charges of espionage and other security-related offences. Uganda's Foreign Affairs Minister, Sam Kutesa, is quoted by the Daily Monitor newspaper as saying: "The withdrawal of the charges against these people does not in any way suggest that the accused are innocent of the charges for which they were being tried." The diplomatic row was sparked by accusations of interference in each other's affairs.
