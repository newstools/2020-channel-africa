Since returning in June 2020, the tour had aimed to have fans back at events at the Jack Nicklaus-hosted event in Muirfield Village at Dublin, Ohio. But there were 968 cases of the deadly virus across the state of Ohio on Sunday, 42 more than the day before, and a state-high 248 of them were in Franklin County, the Columbus area where the PGA is staging events this week and next. Ohio's Covid-19 death toll reached 2 911 with 19 killed on Sunday. "The Memorial tournament and the PGA Tour have made the right decision in not allowing spectators to attend this year," Ohio Governor Mike DeWine said. "I know it was a difficult decision to make, but the organizers of the Memorial tournament have put the health and safety of players and fans first." No timetable was given for when the PGA might eventually welcome spectators during tournaments.Â 

"While this was a difficult decision, it was one made collectively, and we are appreciative of the process undertaken to this point that will allow us to welcome on-site fans when the time is right," US PGA Tour commissioner, Jay Monahan, said. --News24--
