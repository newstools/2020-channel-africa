SAA went into business rescue in December last year following years of losses and repeated state bailouts. The business rescue practitioners published their rescue plan earlier in the week after repeated delays.

The practitioners have informed all affected parties and other holders of voting interests under the Companies Act that a meeting to vote on the plan "to determine the future of the company" will take place on June 25 at 11:00. The meeting will take place over the internet.    

Under the terms of the rescue plan published late on Tuesday evening, government will have to raise more than $58 million to keep the airline from going under. This $58 million proposed by the practitioners excludes about $93 million in historic government-guaranteed debt already allocated in previous budgets.    

Creditors, which include employees, have a right to vote to amend the plan, approve it or reject it. Voting interests are equal to the value of the amount owed to creditors. 
   
Local banks, who are owed a total of $93 million secured by government guarantees, form the largest voting bloc.  

In terms of the act, employees are entitled to make a submission before a vote takes place. Government, as shareholder of the airline, is not entitled to vote to approve or reject the proposed plan.

Creditors who for any reason are unable to attend the electronic meeting, are entitled to vote by a proxy form, which must be forwarded to BRPs prior to 17:00 on June 24.
