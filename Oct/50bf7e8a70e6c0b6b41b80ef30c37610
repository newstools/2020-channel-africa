In order to minimise the risk of Covid-19 infections, government directed the reopening of examination classes first, and teachers who are supposed to take care of these pupils have been reporting for duty. Primary and Secondary Education Minister Cain Mathema said an average of 29 % of teachers have been reporting for duty countrywide, which is enough. There have been threats of industrial action from teachers’ unions to apply pressure in salary negotiations. In response, Minister Mathema acknowledged that teachers have their concerns, but said the low turnout was as a result of the phased reopening approach. “It is correct that a number of teachers are not at work. On average about 29 % are going to work. Remember only examination classes are back at school and those teachers going to work suffice the job at hand. The teachers have their concerns and Government is addressing them. I want to assure learners and parents that exams will go on as scheduled. Learning will not be disrupted. “The first phase has resumed classes safely and we are now preparing for the next phase as well as putting in place measures to protect those already at school,” said Minister Mathema. Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare Minister Professor Paul Mavima said Government held a meeting with teachers’ union representatives on Monday. --Herald--
