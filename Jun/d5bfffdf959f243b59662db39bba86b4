This was despite the business rescue practitioners arguing that delaying the meeting could have a detrimental impact on the airline, because the plan gives July 15 as the deadline for government to come up with about $590 million in funding to prevent SAA from having to be liquidated. A number of creditors, including three unions, namely the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA), South African Cabin Crew Association (SACCA) and the SAA Pilots Association (SAAPA), requested an adjournment as they wanted more time to propose a better plan and to engage with government to get the commitment for funding. The proposed plan has the support of government. However, should there be a requirement to amend the plan, this could impact the funding aspect. According to the practitioners, the $590 million funding the plan foresees is already at the threshold government can consider raising. Since Finance Minister Tito Mboweni did not allocate any funds for SAA in his supplementary budget on Wednesday, funding would likely have to come from a private investor. NUMSA and SACCA said they are very relieved that the adjournment was granted. In their view, "the inadequate plan" proposed by the practitioners would have resulted in SAA being liquidated. "This period offers all stakeholders a golden opportunity for all of us to work together to improve on the plan, and work together towards a better plan, for the long term sustainability of the airline," they said in a statement. The National Transport Movement said in a statement that it was "vehemently opposed" to the postponement of the meeting, because it believes that the wait has huge financial prejudice to all SAA
employees.

The practitioners explained that, once the plan is adopted, the requirements would have to be fulfilled, the most important of these being funding. If funding is obtained in time, then a retrenchment process of employees not accommodated as part of the plan will have to commence. --News24--
