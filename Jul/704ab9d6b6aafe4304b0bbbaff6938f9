Real looked as if they were going to be frustrated until Mathias Olivera fouled Dani Carvajal, with Ramos stepping up to score his 21st consecutive penalty. Getafe, who are in contention for a Champions League place - started well and Thibaut Courtois had to make three saves in the opening 12 minutes. The derby was a physical battle at times with 10 players booked in total. Real did not have many big chances against their less illustrious neighbours, with Luka Modric having a shot deflected wide and Karim Benzema dragging an effort away from goal. Real Madrid only need to win four of their final five games to finish above Barca for their second La Liga title since 2012. --BBC--
