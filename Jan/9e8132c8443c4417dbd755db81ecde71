FakhfakhEconomic says politics will change toward a social policy that returns hope for the unemployed youth and for improving public services. “The result of the presidential election was a strong message in favor of big change,” he said, indicating he would only seek to bring into his government parties “aligned to the values of the revolution”. However, he said he would keep up with economic reforms that the country has been carrying out for years aimed at tackling big deficits and a growing public debt burden. President Kais Saied designated Fakhfakh as the next Prime Minister on Monday, giving him a month to form a government that can win majority backing in the deeply fragmented parliament. His attempt to form a government follows an unsuccessful bid by Habib Jemli, whose proposed coalition lost a confidence vote on January 10. If Fakhfakh is also unsuccessful there will be another parliamentary election. The young democracy, which threw off autocratic rule in a 2011 uprising, held two separate elections for parliament and president in September and October.
