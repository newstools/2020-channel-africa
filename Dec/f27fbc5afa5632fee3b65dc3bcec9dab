Ramaphosa was speaking during the AU Heads of State and Government virtual sessions. He sought to emphasize the African Union’s agenda on the theme; silencing the guns across the continent. “As we march towards the start of trading under the African Continental Free Trade Area on 1 January 2021, we are mindful that its success cannot be separated from a stable and conducive business environment that is able to attract foreign direct investment. We need to address the root causes of conflict in our societies through a multifaceted approach that will require improved governance, respect for human rights and the political will to capacitate our institutions.” Ramaphosa called leaders across the continent to work together to stop acts of violence and terrorism in Africa. He expressed concern for what is happening in Western Sahara. “We must condemn the acts of violence, terrorism and violent extremism as seen in the Sahel region and that now are spreading to other parts of the continent, including Mozambique. We equally express our grave concern about the current situation in Western Sahara. We need to reaffirm our commitment to the full and successful implementation of the AU master roadmap of practical steps to silence the guns in Africa.”
