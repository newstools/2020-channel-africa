Ugandan gold exports have more than doubled in one year, fuelling the concerns.Â 

Its biggest market is the United Arab Emirates, having overtaken countries of the East African Community. The campaign group Impact, which is based in Canada, says the authorities in Rwanda and Uganda need to clamp down on smuggling of Congolese gold across their borders. It claims just a small fraction of the 15 to 22 tonnes mined in DRC every year is officially recorded and exported.
