Maesaiah was detained and charged this week for the murder of Prime Minister Thomas Thabaneâ€™s estranged wife Lipolelo, who was shot dead near her home in the capital, Maseru, on June 14, 2017, at the age of 58. Her lawyer Rethabile Setlojoane said she would not comment on the allegations as she has yet to enter a plea.
