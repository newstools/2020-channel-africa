Song played the first half as his Arta Solar 7 side from Djibouti lost 9-1 in Egypt to Arab Contractors, who are also known as Al Mokawloon Al Arab. There was better news for another former Premier League player as Zambia striker, Emmanuel Mayuka, as he helped Napsa United beat hosts Ngazi Club of Comoros 5-1. Mayuka, who had a spell at Southampton scored in both legs of the tie helping his Zambian side complete a 9-2 aggregate win. Two second leg ties did not go ahead as planned with Gambian side Gamtel withdrawing from the tournament and South Sudan's Al Rabita being disqualified. Gamtel, who had lost the first leg at home 1-0, cited financial problems for their failure to travel to Morocco to play Tihad Casablanca. The Gambia Football Federation confirmed the news in a statement and pointed out that it had given some financial and logistical help to Gamtel to prepare for the first leg. Al Rabita were disqualified after the South Sudan Football Federation failed to send air tickets to the Confederation of African Football (CAF) for the match officials. The second leg of the tie against Namungo had been moved to be played in Tanzania at the request of Al Rabita and with CAF approval due the problems in South Sudan. Tanzania's Namungo had won the first leg last week 3-0. It means Namungo and Tihad Casablanca advance to the next round of Confederation Cup qualifying the winners of those ties will play the losers from the Champions League last-32 losers for group places --BBC--
