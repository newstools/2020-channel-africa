Human rights activists have long accused Karti of being implicated in crimes committed by the state as far back as the 1990s when he was in charge of a government militia responsible for widespread abuses in southern Sudan. Karti has frequently denied any abuses were carried out by the Sudanese state when Bashir was in power. The former president who was ousted last year is wanted by the International Criminal Court for genocide, and is also on trial in Sudan over the killing of protesters and the 1989 military coup. --BBC--
