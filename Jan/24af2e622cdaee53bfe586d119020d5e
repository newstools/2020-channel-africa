She said the other detainees were two airport ground workers and one cargo worker and all seven were expected to give statements before a court on Thursday. Media reports said Turkey’s interior ministry had begun an investigation into Ghosn’s transit. The former Nissan (7201.T) boss revealed on Tuesday he had fled to Beirut to escape what he called a “rigged” justice system. People familiar with the matter told Reuters that Ghosn, one of the world’s best-known executives, had arrived in Beirut on a private jet from Istanbul on Monday. Hurriyet news website, citing an interior ministry official, said Turkish border police were not notified about Ghosn’s arrival, and neither his entry nor exit were registered. A plane carrying Ghosn arrived at 5:30 am (0230 GMT) Monday at Istanbul’s Ataturk Airport, Hurriyet reported, adding that prosecutors ordered the arrests after widening their investigation. Flight tracking data from that time suggests that Ghosn used two different planes to fly into Istanbul and then on to Lebanon. Japanese authorities allowed Ghosn to carry a spare French passport in a locked case while out on bail, public broadcaster NHK said on Thursday, shedding some light on how he managed his escape to Lebanon.
