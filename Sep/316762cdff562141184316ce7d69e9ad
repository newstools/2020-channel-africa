Brent crude LCOc1 settled down 36 cents, or 0.8%, to $44.07 a barrel. US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures were down 14 cents, or 0.3%, at $41.37 a barrel. Both benchmarks fell more than 2% earlier in the session. US stock prices sank as investors sold high-flying tech stocks and worried about economic recovery after Labor Department data showed the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment reached a seasonally adjusted 881 000 for the latest week. 

Continuing claims remained high, with millions out of work. A day earlier both oil benchmarks fell more than 2% after U. Energy Information Administration (EIA) data showed domestic gasoline demand last week fell to 8.78 million barrels per day (bpd) from 9.16 million bpd a week earlier. 

Consumption of other oil products also fell. 

“The market failed to react positively to the drawdown in inventories and then threw in the towel for the Labor Day weekend,” said Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. Analysts warn that upcoming refinery maintenance and the end of the summer driving season could also limit crude demand.
