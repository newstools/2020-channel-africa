In a statement on Monday, the ministry added that the 26-year-old entered Zimbabwe in February from Thailand, and was referred from a private clinic to Wilkins Infectious Disease Hospital in Harare complaining of a fever and sneezing.

According to Zimbabwe's Health Ministry, he did not meet the World Health Organisation definition of a suspected case but was still earmarked for a Covid-19 test due to intensified surveillance that the country has adopted."

After the man fled the hospital "follow-up efforts to his home address were initiated and a police report was made", the statement added.Â
