The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, told a group of visiting US Jewish leaders that the first Israeli plane crossed Sudan on Saturday, bound for South America. He said the new air corridor would cut the flying time on the route by three hours. Sudan said in early Ferbruary that it had given initial approval for Israeli planes to fly over its territory. Netanyahu said Israel was discussing rapid normalisation of ties with its former foe. Sudan, which has close ties with the Palestinians, has stopped short of referring to improving ties with Israel.
