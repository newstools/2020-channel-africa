The 39-year-old former champion is excited by what the Africa-born players can offer in this year's play-offs. "This is history because for it’s the first time we have so many Africans in the play-offs. I am so excited," Mbenga, who played for Belgium, told BBC Sport Africa. "I'm looking forward to see them playing at the highest level possible and destroy everybody around them. I’ll be texting that to all of them." This year's play-offs will feature six players born in Africa, with three of those expected to be regulars players for their teams. Two of those hail from Cameroon, and are both 26-years-old with, Joel Embiid at the Philadelphia 76ers and Pascal Siakam playing for the defending champions the Toronto Raptors. The Raptors also have Serge Ibaka, 30, who was born in Congo-Brazzaville and played for Spain internationally, on their roster. While Sudan-born Bol Bol, 20, son of the late NBA player Manut Bol, plays for the Denver Nuggets, Egyptian Abdel Nader, 26, features for Oklahoma City Thunder and Senegalese Tacko Fall, 24, is with the Boston Celtics. Senegalese basketball fans will also be looking out for Georges Niang at Utah Jazz, whose father was born and raised in Senegal. --BBC--
