Armed men reportedly stormed the High Commission in the early hours of Saturday and demolished the newly constructed building. The building was intended to serve as residence for staff and visiting diplomats. Ghana’s deputy foreign affairs Minister, Charles Owiredu, told BBC Pidgin that “what transpired was so unfortunate; the High Commission and embassies are inviolable within the Vienna Convention”. “You cannot enter a diplomatic mission without being invited and the responsibility to protect a diplomatic mission lies with the host which is Ghana; so that will have to be dealt with,” Owiredu added. Nigeria’s Foreign Affairs Minister Goeffrey Onyeama has described the demolition as an “outrageous criminal attack.” Ghana’s foreign affairs officials will on Monday meet with colleagues from the ministry of national security and the lands commission to resolve the dispute. --BBC--
