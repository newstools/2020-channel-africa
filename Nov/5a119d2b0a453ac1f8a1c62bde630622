The postponement follows the death of advocate Zukile Mdolombo, who was part of the state’s legal team. Advocate Mdolomba successfully opposed Omotoso’s bail application in the High Court in Port Elizabeth a few weeks ago. He was one of the three prosecutors in the rape and human trafficking case against Omotoso. The clerk of the court has also tested positive for the coronavirus. Meanwhile, Judge Irma Schoeman dismissed the application from the defence to have the evidence of two witnesses declared inadmissible. Omotoso and two co-accused are facing more than 90 sex-related charges.
