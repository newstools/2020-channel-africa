The rapid spread of the coronavirus has caught many countries on the back foot, leading to a growing number of nations placing themselves on virtual lockdown. The Anglo-Australian miner said production at its Richards Bay Minerals in South Africa will be halted on Thursday for 21 days, in line with a nationwide lockdown after the number of cases sharply rose. It was too early to predict the impact of the disruption to operations on its production forecast for fiscal 2020, or when things will get back to normal, Rio said in a statement. In Canada, Rio Tinto said it was working to comply with the Quebec government’s directive to reduce business activity after the province tightened restrictions, including ordering the closure of all non-essential businesses. “We will continue to work with our employees, customers, communities and suppliers to minimise any impact of action being taken to reduce the spread of COVID-19,” Chief Executive Officer, Jean-Sébastien Jacques, said. --Reuters--
