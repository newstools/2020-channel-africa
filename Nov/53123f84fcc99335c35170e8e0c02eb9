A spokesperson for the UN humanitarian affairs agency, Saviano Abreu, said it had been blocked from sending staff or supplies. In a BBC interview, he called for freedom of movement to be restored for aid workers as well as for civilians fleeing the conflict. The UN refugee agency says the number of people who've crossed into Sudan has climbed to 40 000. The UN Security Council is due to hold its first meeting later on Tuesday to discuss the fighting in Tigray.
