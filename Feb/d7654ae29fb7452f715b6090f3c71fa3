Last Friday, City were issued with a two-year suspension from European competition by governing body UEFA after being found guilty of Financial Fair Play rule breaches, a ruling the club are appealing at the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Pep Guardiola's side could also lose their 2014 league title if a separate Premier League investigation found that they breached financial rules, which City deny, and deducted points retrospectively. "I read that myself this morning," Rangers Manager, Gerrard, who was captain of Liverpool when they finished two points behind City in 2014, said after his side's win over Livingston on Sunday. "We will wait and see. From a UEFA point of view, it is obviously a really strong sentence or punishment. I'm sure they will appeal so we will wait and see what the outcome is on that. Then we will see whether the Premier League act from there. But if you look at the severity of the punishment from UEFA, something has gone badly wrong.” Gerrad said. "So, I'm really interested to see the outcome of that. Until I get the punishment from the Premier League, I won't comment further. But I'm really, really interested in it...for obvious reasons.” He added. --News24--
