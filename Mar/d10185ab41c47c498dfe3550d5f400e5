All football has been suspended until further notice after President Cyril Ramaphosa prohibited public gatherings of more than 100 people as a measure to mitigate the risk of spreading the coronavirus. Khoza has emphasised the importance of following safety protocol to the letter in order to ensure human lives are not put at risk in these uncertain times. "We suspended our programme because of the state president's directive. And the question was, do we comply? And the meeting said we comply in terms of the requirements dictated by the president that you can do business if a 100-member limit is taken into account, which we have complied with," said Khoza, as quoted by IOL. "For now, insofar as we are doing, we want to understand the regulations and comply because we are dealing with human lives," Khoza said. "The clubs are exposed to consequences if we don't take the necessary steps. That's why we are working in conjunction with the department of health to make sure that we must not make the clubs vulnerable to any kind of claims because this is business unusual, so, therefore, we must take proper steps. This isn't only happening to us, but it is happening to all of the workforces. "Don't see us (as) just football people, we are employers and employees. We are part of corporate. The collective understanding is to make sure that we listen to the voice of the government and ensure that things are done properly. "We have to make sure that all things are done properly, hence our stance to make sure that we must assist the government in making sure that people comply with the habits of keeping safe by washing hands, avoiding handshakes and all the things that the government is saying we must do."
