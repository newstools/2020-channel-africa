The Public Enterprises Pravin Gordhan-led department released a statement on Monday evening, following separate meetings it held with organised labour at the airline. The meetings were held to discuss options for employees ahead of next week Tuesday's vote on the business rescue plan for South African Airways (SAA). Unions that expressed an intention to sign voluntary severance packages were the National Transport Movement, South African Transport and Allied Workers Union, Aviation Union of Southern Africa and Solidarity. "They further said that they support the VSPs, which include one week calculated per year of completed service, one-month notice pay, accumulated leave paid out, a thirteenth cheque and a top-up of severance packages calculated on a back-dated 5.9% wage increase which was agreed to in November last year," the statement said. The department urged the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa), the SA Cabin Crew Association (Sacca) and the SAA Pilots Association to hold their own bilateral meetings with members on the matter. Numsa and Sacca have threatened legal action, should a decision be taken to liquidate the national carrier. --News24--
