Toyota has failed until now to win drivers over to fuel cell vehicles (FCV), which remain a niche technology despite Japanese government backing, amid concerns about lack of fuelling stations, resale values and the risk of hydrogen explosions. “The new Mirai will serve as a new departure point for creating a hydrogen-based society of the future,” Toyota said in a statement. It will cost about $48 000 after subsidies, about the same as its predecessor. By the end of September Toyota had sold only 11,100 of its first generation Mirai, almost six years after its launch. Most other automakers have eschewed FCV in favour of electric vehicles (EV). In 2019, automakers sold 2.1 million electric cars, 40% more than the previous year, the International Energy Agency says. The new Mirai launch comes after Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga announced a goal in October to cut Japan’s carbon emissions to zero by 2050.
