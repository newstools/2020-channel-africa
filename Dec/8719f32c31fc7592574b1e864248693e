The more time that goes by the less likely it is that we will have a deal in place on the first of January, that’s just a statement of fact,” Commission Spokesperson, Daniel Ferrie, told a news briefing. “I cannot say what may or may not happen over these days. But what I can say, though, is that we are fully dedicated to trying to reach a deal with the United Kingdom.” --Reuters--
