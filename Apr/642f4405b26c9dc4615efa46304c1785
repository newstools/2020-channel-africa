Last week, the World Health Organization (WHO) said there was no proof of a cure for Covid-19 after the president launched the treatment, which had been developed in Madagascar. It was being marketed in a bottle and as a herbal tea after being tested on fewer than 20 people over a period of three weeks, the President's chief of staff Lova Hasinirina Ranoromaro told the BBC. President Rajoelina tweeted on Friday that his Senegalese counterpart, Macky Sall, had made the first order. But a source quoted by RFI said that no such order was made. Sall has tweeted that his country is following the research "with interest". --BBC--
