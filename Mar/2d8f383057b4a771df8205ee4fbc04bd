Moses Wetangula said "not concealing identities" would help with contact tracing, because it would allow people "to quickly take measures and go for diagnosis". Kenya's 2017 Health Act states that "health status, treatment or stay in a health facility is confidential except where such information is disclosed under order of court or informed consent for health research and policy planning purposes". Wetangula's statement has received backing online with some Kenyans asking the authorities to reveal the areas that patients have visited. "DCI Kenya help us identify the 85 people the new Patient ZERO came into contact with. You trace us with our phones and arrest us, you use phone triangulation to tell us who was where, Now use Technology for PUBLIC GOOD!," former government official, Dennis Itumbi, tweeted. "For someone to know if he came into contact please give details of these patients and their physical addresses. It is the only way for us to come forward," Twitter user, Eric Ocharo, said. Wetangula's FORD-Kenya party shared the full statement online. --BBC--
