The nine strains are not any different from the one circulating globally. The team of scientists analysed 122 genomes collected from symptomatic and asymptomatic patients in the capital, Nairobi, and the coastal city of Mombasa. "The analysis further suggests that infections detected and confirmed in March 2020 were largely from virus importation into the country, " read the report by Kenya Medical Research Institute (Kemri). The samples were collected from cases detected in Kenya between 12 March and 25 May. "This successful sequencing for the novel coronavirus SARS Cov-2 in Kenya is a significant milestone in the response to the pandemic in Kenya as this will strengthen surveillance for tracking mutations of the virus and aid in the tracing of the sources of community infections,‚Äù Professor Yeri Kombe, head of the institute, said in a statement. The World Health Organization's Regional - Director for Africa Dr Matshidiso Moeti noted that scientists globally have analysed some 103 samples out of which they have been able to find two strains, L and S types, that are circulating globally, with L being more severe. --BBC--
