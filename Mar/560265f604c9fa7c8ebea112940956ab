Reflecting on the national budget that Finance Minister Tito Mboweni delivered last week, Ramaphosa says in his weekly letter that South Africa was in a precarious and unsustainable situation in which spending outstripped earning, attracting rising debt servicing costs He says a large part of achieving savings will come from reducing the rate at which the wage bill grows, which has begun affecting spending on capital projects for future growth and items that are critical for service delivery. Governmentâ€™s total allocations for this financial year amounts to $125 billion and almost half of that will go towards social spending. The President says that in order to keep public finances under control, the focus must be to curb the rate of growth of wages rather than dramatically cut the size of the public service. He says discussions with public sector unions must be held to find a solution. Ramaphosa also says there will be no increase in the salaries of senior public servants this year and a new law will be published which will introduce a remuneration framework for board members and executives. He says government aims to save around $13.2 billion over the next three years. --SABC--
