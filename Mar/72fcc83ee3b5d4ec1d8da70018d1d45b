The US Golf Association said in a statement to GolfChannel.com that it continues "to hold the dates for the US Open at Winged Foot in June" while it also monitors guidance and regulations from the Centres for Disease Control, the World Health Organisation and state and local authorities. In the meantime, work that had begun on tournament infrastructure such as corporate hospitality tents and grandstands has been halted. The USGA acknowledged that the championship, scheduled for 18-21 June, might have to be postponed, but said it was too soon to make that call. "We are continuing to monitor the situation and making relevant contingency plans," USGA chief brand officer Craig Annis told the Journal News newspaper that serves Westchester County. "We expect to make a decision sometime in the middle of April."
