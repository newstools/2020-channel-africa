This is an increase of 218 from Wednesday. Gauteng still has the highest number with 409 confirmed cases. The Western Cape and KwaZulu-Natal-Natal are following with 229 and 134 cases, respectively. Gauteng has almost half of the nationâ€™s positive cases of COVID-19. This may be attributed to the province being the biggest gateway into the country. The Free State has 49 cases, but the number is expected to increase rapidly after two churches that had mass gatherings this month confirmed that some of their congregants had tested positive for the viral infection. The announcement of the new cases comes as South Africa prepares for a national lockdown which starts on Thursday midnight. President Cyril Ramaphosa has again appealed to South Africans to adhere to the lockdown regulations. He has also called on the country to pray over the pandemic on Thursday evening.
