The service, initially launched on April 6, was aimed at helping Parisians buy essential goods and food during the nationwide lockdown triggered by the coronavirus crisis. Offering 30-minute home delivery, it started with around 15 Carrefour stores in and around Paris. As of July 20, it had been expanded to 330 stores, the statement said. Outside France, Carrefour, which already has a home delivery partnership with Uber Eats in Taiwan, will launch the service in September in Belgium. --Reuters--
