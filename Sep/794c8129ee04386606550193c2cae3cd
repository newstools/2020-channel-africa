ZINA did raise the issue of transport costs, but some nurses live in Government flats near hospitals and transport is available. Patients are receiving medical attention on time and closed clinical services are re-opening. Acting Chief Executive Officer for Mpilo Central Hospital, Professor Solwayo Ngwenya, said nurses are back at work and today they will be rolling-out all clinical activities. “We are very happy here, almost all our nurses are back at work. Only a few, less than 10 %, had problems with transport. But we can safely say all our nurses are back. On Wednesday everyone who was supposed to be on duty was there which is very good and it is going to improve our service delivery. “Today onwards we are now expanding our services. We had suspended some because of manpower. We had stopped doing outpatients. We had also merged some wards. So we are now going to open up, we had done this as a survival strategy,” said Ngwenya. The situation at Masvingo Provincial Hospital had also normalised. Acting medical superintendent Dr Noel Zulu said the situation at Masvingo Provincial Hospital was normalising. Despite a strike called by the nurses association in Manicaland, most of them ignored the call and have also been reporting for duty as usual. ZINA secretary-general Enock Dongo this week said they had communicated with their members to start reporting for duty if they could raise money for transport. “We welcome what the Vice President and Minister of Health and Child Care said that he is willing to improve the conditions of service and remuneration for health workers so we are giving them a chance to do that while we are going to work,” said Dongo.  --Herald--
