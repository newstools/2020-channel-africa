The Interior Ministry is quoted as saying that the three Libyans, all in their 30s, stormed a Tripoli factory where African migrants were working, detained one the workers, a Nigerian, poured petrol on him and set him on fire. The Chief of mission for the International Organization for Migration tweeted that he was "horrified" at what he called "yet another senseless crime against migrants in the country". Migrants from sub-Saharan Africa are known to stop in Libya before attempting to cross the Mediterranean to reach Europe. --BBC--
