Meanwhile, a rainstorm accompanied by strong winds has left a trail of destruction in southern Mozambique. Those killed by the lightning strikes include an elderly woman and a toddler. One person was injured and some houses were set alight, according to Tete's National Disaster Management Institute delegate Alex Angelo. In the country's southern province of Maputo the Tuesday night rainstorm destroyed some infrastructure. The storm also destroyed homes, uprooted trees and electricity poles and blew away the roofs of some schools and a local prosecutorâ€™s office. The destruction occurred mainly in four districts within the province.The meteorological authorities predict the bad weather may continue for four more days. The situation is likely to cause flooding in the cities of Beira and Dondo, which were devastated by cyclone Idai last year, and cause erosion in Chimoio. Meteorologist Acacio Tembe says the torrential rains are beginning a week earlier than expected and they will continue for long, something, he says, is likely to cause the flooding of the Buzi and Pungue rivers. --BBC--
