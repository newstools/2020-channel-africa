The FIA, Formula 1's governing body, has accepted a request from Chinese organisers to postpone the Shanghai race, due to take place on 19 April. In a statement, it added all parties would take the "appropriate amount of time" to discuss potential new dates. The decision has been made to "ensure the health and safety" of drivers, staff and fans. "The Chinese Grand Prix has long been an important part of the F1 calendar with many passionate fans," the statement continued. "The FIA F1 community looks forward to racing in China as soon as possible and wishes everyone in the country the best during this difficult time." F1 Managing Director, Ross Brawn, has previously said there would be efforts to reschedule the race if it could not be held on its original date. "We will leave open the opportunity to see if the race can run later in the year," he said. "China is an enthusiastic, growing market so we'd like to have a race in China." The last time a race was postponed was 2011, when the Bahrain Grand Prix was affected by the Arab Spring uprisings. The initial intention then was to run the race later in the year but the teams objected and in the end the race was cancelled. There have now been more than 40 000 cases of the new coronavirus strain worldwide, and it has been declared a global health emergency. The death toll in China stands at 1 016. --BBC--
