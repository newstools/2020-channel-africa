Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who came to power in 2018 promising democratic changes in one of Africa’s most repressive nations, is struggling to rein in resurgent ethnic nationalism that sporadically explodes in bouts of violence. Abiy’s changes have unleashed old disputes over land, resources and local power, and he now faces the challenge of protecting citizens while preserving fledgling freedoms that helped win him the Nobel peace prize in 2019. 

He’s promised to hold Ethiopia’s first free and fair elections in 2021, which would be a milestone for Africa’s second most-populous nation. But the state-run Ethiopian Human Rights Commission said around 9000 people had been arrested since the June 29 shooting of a musician sparked days of protests that killed more than 178 people in the capital and surrounding Oromiya region - the deadliest spasm of violence since Abiy took office. Asked to comment on the arrests, the government signalled that order was its immediate priority. Billene Seyoum, a spokespersn for the prime minister, told Reuters, “One of the government’s primary roles and responsibilities is ensuring security and stability and that the rule of law prevails ... actions taken over the past weeks are a reflection of the commitment to law and constitutional order.”  Abiy’s critics detect disturbing echoes of the past.
