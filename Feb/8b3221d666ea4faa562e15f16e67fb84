The state-owned Herald newspaper reports that the 27-year-old travelled from China to Zimbabwe and was isolated on arrival and tested. Harare's Director for Health Services, Prosper Chonzi, told the BBC's Shingai Nyoka that the woman worked as a teacher in the city of Wuhan, which is the epicentre of the virus. Chonzi said the woman was on holiday in the city of Guangzhou and became unwell, displaying symptoms of coronavirus. She was however tested in China and given a certificate showing her results were negative. On Tuesday she arrived in Zimbabwe and airport health officials found that she had a fever. She was taken to an isolation unit in Harare's Wilkins Hospital where tests were conducted and her temperature was continuously monitored. By Wednesday night she had a normal temperature, the Herald reports. Zimbabwe's permanent secretary for information, Nick Mangwana, says the tests were carried out at nearby Sally Mugabe Central Hospital. --BBC--
