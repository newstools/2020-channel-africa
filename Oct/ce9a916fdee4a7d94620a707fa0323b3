In Zimbabwe it is largely used by small-scale miners in the recovery of gold. Gold is one of Zimbabwe’s largest foreign currency earners and more than 60% of it comes from small-scale miners who use mercury in their recovery processes. It is against this background that government has taken a proactive role in the quest for a seamless substitution of mercury. Speaking in Kadoma on Tuesday at a Minamata Convention ratification sensitisation workshop, Mines and Mining Development Deputy Minister Polite Kambamura, said government will adopt policies that will guarantee continued productivity in the gold value chain. Zimbabwe is a signatory to Minamata having signed in October 2013, and Kambamura said there was need to ratify it in light of the need to influence the direction and pace of the Convention, on challenges and dangers associated with the use of mercury. Kambamura called on stakeholders, among them gold miners and environmentalists to be frank in their engagements with Government in order to find a solution that doesn’t disadvantage the mining sector. There is need for stakeholders in the mining sector to explore safer gold recovery technologies so that miners, their families and the environment are saved from the devastating effects of mercury emissions,” said Kambamura. “Upon ratification of the Minamata Convention, Government will come up with policy interventions so that the artisanal miners continue to contribute positively as we drive towards the achievement of a US$12 billion mining sector by 2023. --Herald--
