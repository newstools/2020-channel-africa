A rising number of migrant workers, particularly from Asia, head to the US to work in Silicon Valley. Alongside Mexico, China and India now provide large numbers of the new working population. This supply of talent could soon be cut off under Trump's temporary ban, aimed at stopping the virus spreading and protecting American jobs. According to Pew Research Centre, more than one million immigrants arrive in the US each year, although this figure has fallen in recent years. In 2017, India accounted for most of the new foreign workforce, followed by Mexico, China and Cuba. --Reuters--
