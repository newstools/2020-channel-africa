Didier Drodga said that the suggestion was taking "African people as human guinea pigs," adding in another tweet that "Africa isn't a testing lab": Former Cameroonian football Samuel Eto'o called the doctors "assassins". The doctors' comments were also criticised by ant-racist groups and many others commenting online. The 1 April clip from French TV channel LCI featuring Dr Jean-Paul Mira and Dr Camille Locht has been widely shared online. In it Dr Mira, from Cochin hospital in Paris, proposes that a medical trial for a Covid-19 vaccine should be carried out in Africa as it had been done in studies relating to Aids: Dr Camille Locht, from the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research (Inserm), agreed with Dr Mira, saying: Following the controversy, Inserm said in a statement that the video was “the subject of erroneous interpretations”: “Clinical trials to test the efficacy of the BCG vaccine against Covid-19 are... about to be launched in European countries and in Australia. If there is indeed a reflection around a deployment in Africa, it would be done in parallel with these. Africa must not be forgotten or excluded from research because the pandemic is global." BCG is a vaccination mostly given to babies in countries where tuberculosis is common. Some recent studies have suggested that countries where BCG is administered reported fewer deaths related to Covid-19. --BBC--
