The hosts were bowled out for 200 early on the fourth day, leaving India needing only 70 to win at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG). Debutant Mohammed Siraj took 3-37, including Cameron Green, who offered some resistance in making 45 for Australia. India slipped to 19-2 before Shubman Gill, another debutant, and stand-in captain Ajinkya Rahane saw them home. Gill, who made 45 in the first innings, finished unbeaten on 35 and man of the match Rahane followed up his first-innings century with 27 not out. It was a remarkable turnaround for India, who were bowled out for 36 in an eight-wicket defeat in Adelaide just over a week ago. The third Test of a thrilling four-match series begins on January 6 in Sydney.
