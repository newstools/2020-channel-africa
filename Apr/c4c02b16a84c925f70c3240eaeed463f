It's one of the most important dates in the country's calendar, celebrated annually on April 26. “President John Magufuli has also directed that a sum of 500 million Tanzanian Shillings ($217 000), set as a budget for the Union Day celebrations, should be reallocated to the fund for fighting coronavirus in the country,” said Majaliwa. He also extended the closure of schools, colleges and universities indefinitely as part of the measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus in the country. The closure order was imposed last month, immediately after the first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in the country, and was due to end on Friday. Majaliwa also confirmed four new coronavirus cases, tested in the commercial capital, Dar es Salaam. It brings the total number of cases in the country to 53. Magufuli recently said gatherings in churches and mosques had not been banned yet despite the coronavirus outbreak because that was where there was "true healing". --BBC--
