The 45-year-old coach played for Birmingham City, Bolton Wanderers and Southampton in England during his playing days. Jaidi coached Southampton Under-23s between 2017 and 2019 having retired from professional football in 2012. The Tunis-born tactician guided the team to promotion to Division 1 of the Premier League 2 for the 2019/20 season. Jaidi, who is currently in charge of USL Championship side Hartford Athletic, has opened up about his dream of coaching in the Premier League. “My dream is to go back to England,” Jaidi told The Athletic. “I’ve been a Premier League player and it’s so amazing. I always left the pitch smiling and enjoying the vibes and energy in the stadium. “I aspire to be a Premier League manager in the future, whether that’s at Southampton or somewhere else. I want to be a manager on that level. I think I have the attributes to do that. “I know how players and people around me think. I still need to work on some aspects but this experience in America has already taught me a lot,” he added. “I feel like there is an opportunity for me to experience a higher level and make an impact in the football world.” Athletic are currently placed second in USL Championship Group F having recorded six wins, one draw and two defeats from nine matches. Jaidi played 105 international matches for Tunisia and he netted seven goals in the process.  --AllAfrica--
