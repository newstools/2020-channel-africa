While President Cyril Ramaphosa announced a $29 billion Covid-19 package April, the National Treasury only outlined plans to spend $27 billion in a special adjustment budget presented in June 2020. The plans for the remainder will be outlined in the October medium-term budget policy statement and the February budget review. Pressures in some departments, including those previously earmarked for budget reductions after Ramaphosa’s announcement, "the lack of readiness of certain projects, such as the job-creation program, and a further deterioration in the fiscal position after the President’s announcement, resulted in adjustments to the announced intervention,” the National Treasury said in an emailed response to questions. The total stimulus package will remain at $29 billion, even though the supplementary budget process identified only $9 billion for immediate allocation, the Treasury said. The new grants will require a further reprioritization of spending, it added. "The Treasury has taken a prudent approach to the budget by making allocations in line with credible plans and in a manner designed to mitigate the significantly worsened fiscal situation," it said. South Africa’s gross domestic product (GDP) will probably contract 7.2% in 2020, the most in almost nine decades, due to the coronavirus pandemic and restrictions put in place to curb its spread. The consolidated budget deficit is expected to surge to 15.7% of GDP this year and gross debt-to-GDP is likely to peak at 87.4% in 2023 and 2024, according to government estimates. Africa’s most-industrialised economy is counting on $7 billion from multilateral lenders and development finance institutions to support its response to the pandemic. --News24--
