Senegalese President Macky Sall said the state of emergency would start on Tuesday midnight, accompanied by a curfew from 8:00pm to 6:00am local time (2000GMT to 0600GMT). The military and police have been ordered to execute the measures. The announcement was made in an address to the nation on Tuesday in which Sall acknowledged that the country was struggling to contain the spread of the virus. “Since the appearance of the first case on March 2, the government has put in place a plan to stem the progression of the disease. But, obviously, we're not there yet,” he said. Senegal has 79 confirmed cases of Covid-19, the respiratory illness caused by coronavirus, including eight people who have recovered. More than 1 500 people who are suspected to have been in contact with the confirmed cases are being tracked down. Sall announced a $1.5 billion solidarity and response fund, while $80million will be devoted to emergency food aid. "I say this to you with solemnity - the situation is critical. The speed of the progress of the disease requires us to raise the level of the response,"  Sall is quoted as saying by AFP news agency. In Ivory Coast, President Alassane Ouattara, said the government would introduce gradual confinement measures and a curfew from 9:00pm to 5:00am local time (2100GMT to 0900GMT) ) from Tuesday. "Faced with the progression of the pandemic. I declare a state of emergency throughout the country," the President is quoted as saying by AFP during a televised speech. He ordered the closure of all bars and banned unauthorised movement between the capital, Abidjan, and the interior of the country. --BBC--
