Two men - an Argentine and a Chinese national - were quarantined after displaying symptoms of the virus after going to the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital in the capital, Accra, for treatment. Franklin Asiedu-Bekoe, the head of disease surveillance at the Ghana Health Service, has told BBC Pidgin that the negative results should allay the public's fears. Ghanaian health officials say they will continue to maintain preventive measures to ensure the new virus does not enter the country. The recent outbreak has killed 565 people and infected 28018 - all but one of the deaths have been in China.
