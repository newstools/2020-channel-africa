Breast cancer patient Tendai Gwata told the BBC's Focus of Africa Bola Mosuro that technicians who would usually be flown in to fix the machine cannot do so because of the coronavirus pandemic. Critics of the government accuse it of under-sourcing the health sector and the country's health minister was detained on Friday for alleged corruption. There is a machine that is working in the country's second city of Bulawayo, which is about 450km from the capital. But Gwata says travelling for cancer patients amid the pandemic is not advised. --BBC--
