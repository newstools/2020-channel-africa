In London, the benchmark FTSE 100 share index was down more than 3%, with airlines, travel firms, hotel groups and pubs leading the rout. Worst hit was British Airways owner IAG, which slumped more than 12%. Similar falls were seen on markets in Paris, Frankfurt and Madrid. Banking shares were affected by an extra set of concerns as allegations of money-laundering surfaced in leaked secret files. HSBC, the bank at the centre of the scandal, saw its share price fall more than 5% in London, but the revelations dragged down the entire sector, with Barclays, Lloyds and NatWest all dropping about the same amount. The downward trend affected all but a handful of stocks on the United Kingdom (UK) 100-share index. Only online delivery service Just Eat, supermarkets Tesco and Morrisons and miner Fresnillo made it into positive territory. The FTSE 250 index, seen as a better reflection of the health of the UK economy, was down 4% by lunchtime. --BBC--
