Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the Reds had a rather different celebration than the norm on a Premier League trophy day, as the club went all out to make it a proper title presentation. Jordan Henderson, who will finish the season on the sideline due to injury, was kitted in his usual Liverpool red, including the  captain's armband, to hoist the trophy in the air on a built stage situated in the Kop end of Anfield. Liverpool fans across the globe took to Twitter to celebrate with Jurgen Klopp and his charges while others found the time to continue the football banter.
