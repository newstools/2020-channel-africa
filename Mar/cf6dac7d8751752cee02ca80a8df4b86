BBC's Chris Ewokor reports that the new case is a Nigerian who had been in contact with the Italian who tested positive for coronavirus two weeks ago. The new case was put in isolation and was tested as part of the government's strategy to test everyone who had been in contact with the Italian. "All other contacts of the index case in Ogun & Lagos will remain in isolation & testing will be done on those not yet tested," the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) wrote.
