The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) said attempts would be made to reschedule international fixtures in the period from July until the end of September, including the West Indies Test tour of England. Global cricket is at a standstill as a result of Covid19, with stark warnings issued over the damaging economic fallout. ECB chief executive Tom Harrison said the plan was to reschedule international matches as late as possible in the English season to give the best chance of play. The West Indies tour, including three Tests, had been due to start on June 4. A women's series between England and India, comprising one-day internationals and Twenty20 matches, was scheduled for later in that month. Before that the County Championship had been due to begin two weeks ago, on April 12. "There will be no cricket unless it's safe to play," said Harrison. "Our schedule will only go ahead if government guidance permits. "Our biggest challenge, along with other sports, is how we could seek to implement a bio-secure solution that offers optimum safety and security for all concerned." --News24--
