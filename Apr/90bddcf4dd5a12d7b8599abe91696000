Attacks on civilians, residential areas and a prison break are just a few of a long list of violent incidents ongoing in Libya, according to the UN mission to the country. In a statement on Wednesday, the UN’s political mission says it is alarmed by the intensification of fighting in recent days which resulted in casualties, and warned of a risk of further internal displacement of civilians. The statement highlighted unconfirmed reports of revenge attacks including looting and torching of public and private properties in coastal towns recently re-taken by government aligned forces. Their rivals, the self-styled Libya National Army commanded by Gen Khalifa Haftar was also condemned for indiscriminately shelling the capital Tripoli. Last week, a UN agency official said an armed group also stormed a water control station in Libya to force the release of detained family members – this cut off the main water supplies to large parts of western Libya, including Tripoli. The country has already confirmed 29 cases of coronavirus. --BBC--
