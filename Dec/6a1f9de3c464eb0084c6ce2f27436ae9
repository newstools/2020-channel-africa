The 45-year-old is third on the all-time list of Test run-scorers with 13 289. He also took 292 wickets. Kallis has coached Kolkata Knight Riders in the Indian Premier League and worked with the South Africa team, but was not part of the Proteas set-up for England's recent tour. England play two Tests in Sri Lanka before going on to tour India. Kallis will work under head coach Chris Silverwood and alongside assistant coach Paul Collingwood, wicketkeeping consultant James Foster, fielding coach Carl Hopkinson, bowling coach Jon Lewis and spin bowling consultant Jeetan Patel. Both Tests will be played in Galle, starting on January 14 and January 22. --BBC--
