Sasol jumped 9.69% after it said that it had agreed to sell half of its stake in Gemini HDPE LLC, a producer of bimodal high-density polyethylene to Ineos Olefins and Polymers (O&P) USA. Sasol said that the sale was a step towards accelerating the focus on specialty chemicals and reducing net debt. “Proceeds from the transaction will be used by Sasol to repay near-term debt obligations,” said Sasol. The transaction comes just days after Sasol shareholders voted overwhelmingly in support of the 50% sale of the group’s Lake Charles Chemical Project (LCCP) to LyondellBasel, one of the world’s largest plastics, chemicals and refining companies for $2 billion. More than 99% of shareholders voted in favour of the deal, which also aimed to reduce debt during the company’s general meeting held on Friday. The proposed acquisition would allow Ineos O&P USA to further expand its reach in the specialty polyethylene markets. --IOL--
