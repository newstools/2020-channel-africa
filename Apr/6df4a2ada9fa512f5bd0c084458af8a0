The National Union of Metalworkers (NUMSA) and the South African Cabin Crew Association have rejected the proposed collective agreement from SAA Business Rescue Practitioners for mass retrenchments at SAA. But National Transport Movement President, Mashudu Raphetha, says job losses are inevitable at SAA. On Monday, the South African Parliament's Standing Committee on Public Accounts (SCOP) said the latest developments at SAA are a manifestation of a more profound crisis. Media reports have revealed that SAA, through its business rescue practitioners, has offered severance packages to its entire workforce of around 5 000. The decision comes after government declined a further financial injection of $532 million to rescue the ailing airline. SCOPA Chairperson, Mkhuleko Hlengwa, said they welcome government's decision to turn down the financial request, because SAA's problems are more complex than just money issues. --SABC--
