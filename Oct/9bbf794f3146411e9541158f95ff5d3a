The army confirmed the attack on Baeti village in North Kivu province, around 20 km (12 miles) west of the city of Oicha, but declined to give a death toll. The Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a Ugandan armed group active in eastern Congo since the 1990s, has killed more than 1000 civilians since the start of 2019, according to United Nations (UN) figures, despite repeated military campaigns aimed at destroying it. “We have a provisional death toll of 18 people killed in an atrocious way,” said Kinos Katuho, president of a local civil rights group. “It really creates pain in our hearts, a total panic in the village,” said Masisa Mushogoro, head of a development committee in Baeti. “We don’t know if tomorrow the ADF will come back here again.” Authorities have accused the armed group of attacking the main prison in the city of Beni on October 20, releasing more than 1 300 inmates, including an unknown number of militiamen and their own fighters.
