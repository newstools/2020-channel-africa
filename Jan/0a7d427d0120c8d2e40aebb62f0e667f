The world number two was made to work hard in a hot and humid Sydney by the 14-ranked young gun before prevailing 4-6, 6-1, 7-6 (7/4). His impressive teammate Dusan Lajovic, buoyed by a huge contingent of Serbian fans at Ken Rosewall Arena, earlier crushed world No 21 Felix Auger-Aliassime 6-4, 6-2. "This was the closest match I have ever played against Denis. It was so close it could have gone a different way easily," said Djokovic. "He was playing some terrific tennis and I want to give a huge round of applause and credit to him. Well done." The win sets up a semi-final against Russia, whose two singles players, world number five Daniil Medvedev and the 17th ranked Karen Khachanov, are unbeaten this season. The other last four clashes will see the Nick Kyrgios-led Australia play either Belgium or Rafael Nadal's Davis Cup-winning Spain, who is on court later on Friday. Djokovic faced Shapovalov four times last year and won each match comfortably.
