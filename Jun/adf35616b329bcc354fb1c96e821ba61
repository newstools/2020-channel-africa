Ryan Freeman was terminated “in an effort to discourage other employees from engaging in” legally protected activism, according to a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board, filed by Service Employees International Union (SEIU) on Wednesday, the report said. McDonald’s workers around the country have protested and demanded safety gear. Both McDonald’s and SEIU did not respond to a Reuters request for comment outside regular United States business hours. Freeman was one of five employees who sued McDonald’s in May over working conditions at restaurants during the pandemic. --Reuters--
