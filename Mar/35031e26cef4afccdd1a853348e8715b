The patient is a Moroccan man living in Italy, the Reuters news agency reports, and he is receiving treatment at a hospital in Casablanca. His health condition is not critical, the ministry is quoted as saying in a statement. The case was confirmed after tests at the Institut Pasteur-Maroc returned positive, according to the State-owned Maghreb Agency Press. News of Morocco's first patient on Monday coincides with similar confirmations in Tunisia and Senegal. Tunisiaâ€™s Health Minister Abdelatif-Maki told journalists on Monday that their patient was a 40-year-old Tunisian man, who arrived in the country by boat from Italy on February 27. In Senegal, Health Minister Abdoulaye Diouf Sarr told a press conference that the patient is a Frenchman who lives in Senegal and flew back from France on February 26. The patient reported to a private hospital on February 27 with symptoms including a headache. --BBC--
