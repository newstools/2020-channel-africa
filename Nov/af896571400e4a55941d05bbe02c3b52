The Covid-19 pandemic has amplified this vulnerability with debt-to-GDP ratios exceeding 50%. Latest data by the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) shows that on average over 10% of export revenues and primary income in the region is spent on debt repayments. For example, Kenya spends 22.6% of its export revenue to debt repayment, followed by Burundi 14%, Rwanda 12.6% Uganda 12.2% and Tanzania 8.4% The debt levels have been brought into sharp focus by recent developments in the region. In Uganda, Parliament approved a plan to borrow $600 million from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to plug funding gaps in the current budget made worse by the effects of the coronavirus disease pandemic. In June Ugandaâ€™s debt stood at an estimated $13.11 billion, according to a Central Bank report, with 20 per cent of all public revenues allocated to debt repayments, up 100% in a decade. In June Tanzania said it had begun negotiations with creditors over debt relief to manage the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, including delaying debt repayments meant to start in May to December 2020. The IMF later approved debt relief worth $14.3 million and the government was pursuing up to $272 million more in relief from the European Union. --TheEastAfrican--
