Chief Operating Officer(COO) Alan Gilpin will perform the role of interim CEO until Gosper's replacement is appointed. "It's been a fantastic nine years," said Gosper, a former Australian under-21 international who played club rugby in France. "It has been an absolute privilege to have worked with so many talented and dedicated rugby people around the world. "Rugby is a wonderful sport and World Rugby is a fantastic organisation, and therefore it was a very difficult decision to leave. "But with a new ambitious strategic plan set to launch and the strong foundations in place to drive the sport forward beyond the pandemic, the time is right for me to begin a new challenge." Rugby is a wonderful sport and World Rugby is a fantastic organisation, and therefore it was a very difficult decision to leave, said Brett Gosper. Christopher Halpin, NFL executive vice President and chief strategy and growth officer, praised Gosper's "exceptional skills and experience" "The UK has been a core market of investment and growth for the NFL over the last decade, and we believe broader Europe presents a number of similar attractive opportunities to expand the game and our fan base," he said. "Brettâ€™s exceptional skills and experience make him the ideal leader to build on our momentum and grow the NFL." -Agence France-Presse--
