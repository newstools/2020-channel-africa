Fouad Yousssouf Ali's lawyer says he has refused to eat despite being unwell. The pilot was taken to a hospital for treatment but he refused to be treated citing fear of being poisoned. Ali denied the accusations of attempting to steal a military aircraft. People online have been protesting against his arrest. He had sought asylum in Ethiopia and accused military officials of corruption but was deported back to Djibouti. Ali was arrested and charged with treason and has been in prison. He has in the past accused the prison authorities of mistreating him and his family accused the government of harassing them. The government has denied all allegations. Human Rights Watch urged the Djibouti government to impartially investigate the mistreatment allegations. --BBC--
