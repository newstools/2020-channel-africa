Tweeting on Sunday, Mboweni said he urgently needed to raise more tax and decriminalising cannabis could help accomplish that goal. Mboweni is due to outline plans to contain spending and bolster income in his annual budget speech on February 26. Power shortages have constrained growth, and as a result the National Treasury is confronting a $3.53 billion revenue shortfall for the year through March. Mboweni previously tweeted that legalising marijuana could add more than $270 million to the economy. The finance minister also uses his feed to comment on economic policy to his more than 507 000 followers.
