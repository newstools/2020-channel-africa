As export and tax revenue decline due to subdued global demand and domestic activity, debt costs are eating up a larger share of countries’ income in a region that already spends less than any other on infrastructure. After 25 years of uninterrupted economic growth, gross domestic product in sub-Saharan Africa could contract by 2.8% this year, according to the World Bank. Nigeria, the continent’s largest economy, spent seven times more on debt than new bridges and highways in the first quarter. Ghana’s interest payments in the first four months of the year were the highest since at least 2016. All that contributes to sub-Saharan Africa’s external debt-service bill that’ll be $36.6 billion this year, according to the Institute of International Finance. Unlike richer countries that can afford to pour money into their economies, African governments need to take on more expensive debt to deal with the economic fallout from the pandemic. “The cost of servicing the debt, and the debt overhang, will make a recovery difficult,” Gyude Moore, Liberia’s former minister of public works and senior fellow at the Center for Global Development, said by e-mail. The Group of 20 leading economies’ debt-relief initiative aimed at freeing up funds for poor nations to deal with the pandemic is moving slowly. Since launching in April, 13 of the 73 eligible countries have been granted a suspension and multilateral lenders and private creditors have been hesitant to participate. Senegal’s government said Wednesday it’s started talks with bilateral creditors to delay about $156 million in payments this year, or about 14% of its external debt service. Without help, many countries spending more to tackle the pandemic that epidemiologists say has yet to peak in Africa may be forced into default. That could deter fresh investment and financing, jeopardising the World Bank’s projection for a rebound to 3.1% growth next year. --Bloomberg--
