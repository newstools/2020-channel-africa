Benefiting from improved pricing and a fall in fixed costs, adjusted return on sales at the company’s Mercedes-Benz Cars & Vans division rose to 9.4% in the quarter, up from 7% a year earlier and above the minus 1.5% margin in the second quarter. The car and truck maker said it now expected full-year earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) to reach prior-year levels, compared with the previous expectation of a drop in earnings. The company’s adjusted EBIT rose to €3.479 billion ($4.11 billion) in the quarter, up from €3.14 billion ($3.7 billion) in the year-earlier period. However, quarterly deliveries of Mercedes Benz Cars and Vans were down 4% as the COVID-19 pandemic continued to weigh on demand, prompting Daimler to reiterate that it expects group unit sales and revenue in 2020 to be significantly lower than the previous year. --Reuters--
