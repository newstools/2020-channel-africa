"The approval comes as part of normalising US and Sudanese diplomatic relations after being at the level of charg√© d'affaires for over two decades," the state news agency Suna said quoting Sudan's foreign ministry. Ties between Khartoum and Washington had been strained during Omar al-Bashir's three decades in power, but improved after he was ousted in April 2019. The US closed its embassy in Khartoum in 1996, accusing Sudan of sponsoring terrorism. It reopened in 2002. --BBC--
