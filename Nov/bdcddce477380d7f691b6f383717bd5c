The mining sector together with agriculture have been identified as the two main sectors which should drive the country’s economic revival towards the President’s Vision 2030 by which Zimbabwe should attain upper middle income earning status. In the case of mining, the sector is expected to generate annual exports of up to $12 billion by 2023 from $2.7 billion in 2017. Speaking in Shamva at a function to mark the reopening of Shamva Gold Mine recently, Kambamura said together with Minister Winston Chitando they had made a solid commitment to the President that the milestone will be achieved. Kambamura said they had made the commitment fully aware that the President takes very seriously all issues that have a bearing on people’s lives, with the $12 mining exports milestone being one such issue. “The Honourable Minister Chitando and myself gave a solid commitment to His Excellency that come 2023 we will have a $12 billion mining industry,” said Kambamura. “Now the President takes so seriously commitments that have to do with the people’s lives and we are working tirelessly, sleeves up to see that we deliver to His Excellency and the people of Zimbabwe at large,” he said. The Deputy Minister, however, said Government authorities beginning to see green shoots with indications on the ground point to the milestone in the process of being attained. --Herald--
