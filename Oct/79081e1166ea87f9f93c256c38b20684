It follows the arrest on Monday of Henrietta Rushwaya, 53, the head of an artisanal miners' association. She was arrested while carrying six kilogrammes of gold in her hand luggage at Harare International Airport as she was travelling to Dubai. A spokesperson for the police told the BBC that the latest arrests include some police officers. Media reports indicate that two state security agents have been detained. It is suspected that they rushed Â Rushwaya through airport security checks. She was arrested after airport scanners detected the gold. Police say she did not have the necessary export permits. Rushwaya, who appeared in court on Tuesday and is awaiting bail, denied the charges. The prosecution believes that Rushwaya is part of a wider smuggling ring. Zimbabwe is a major gold producer, and in the past many smuggling rings have benefited from the protection of powerful politicians. --BBC--
