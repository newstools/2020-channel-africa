The campaign group says the Egyptian authorities executed at least 57 people in October and November alone - nearly double the number recorded in the whole of 2019. At least 15 of these executions were related to political violence and sometimes after what Amnesty International described as "grossly unfair" mass trials. The group said the real number was likely to be far higher as the Egyptian authorities do not publish statistics on executions. More than 30 additional executions were reported in pro-government media during the same time period but Amnesty International was not able to independently verify these. --BBC--
