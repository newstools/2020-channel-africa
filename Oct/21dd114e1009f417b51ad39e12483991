Hamilton is out of contract at the end of the year and has yet to start talks with Wolff over a new deal. Wolff told BBC Radio 4: "If an asteroid hits the world, anything can happen. "But at the moment there is no reason he wouldn't want to be in the quickest car and we want him in the car so it's a perfect match." Hamilton broke the all-time Formula 1 record for wins at the Portuguese Grand Prix, taking his 92 career victory, and is likely to win his seventh world championship within two or three races, making him the most successful driver of all time. 

He said before the race in Portugal that he does want to stay with Mercedes but that "there are many questions to answer" about the detail of the contract. One of the issues delaying talks is the threat of coronavirus, and the desire to minimise any risk that Hamilton could catch the disease, forcing him to miss a race and threaten his title campaign.
