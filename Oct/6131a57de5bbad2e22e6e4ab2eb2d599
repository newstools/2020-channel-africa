The tournament, which is in its 75th year and is the oldest of the five women’s golf majors, was previously rescheduled from June to December 10-13 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and will be held at Champions Golf Club in Houston, Texas. “Following extensive consultation with health officials, we have decided that hosting the US Women’s Open without spectators will provide the best opportunity to conduct the championship safely for all involved,” said USGA Senior Managing Director, John Bodenhamer. The PGA Tour said it will allow a limited number of fans to attend November’s Houston Open, a move which concerned Phil Mickelson as the five-time major winner said he was questioning whether to compete in the event. --Reuters--
