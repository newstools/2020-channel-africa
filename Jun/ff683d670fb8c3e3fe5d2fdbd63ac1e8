It's a sad tale, and a tenure one would not have thought a great team like McLaren would ever encounter. The last time the team tasted championship glory was in 2008 when Lewis Hamilton won his first championship with the team. After that, it was a slow and steady fall from dominance. Pundits list various reasons for the team's lack of performance. Among them, squabbles between bosses, the team swapping managers far too often, and driver line-ups that never live up to expectations. From the late 1990s, Mercedes-Benz was the official engine partner for the McLaren team. Famously known as McLaren-Mercedes, the partnership raked in numerous victories and pole positions and was often the title challenger to Ferrari. In 2009, McLaren-Mercedes finished the season in third place, with 2008 champion Hamilton fifth in the drivers' standings. The following year, the team finished second behind Red Bull, and again in 2011. These years were not too bad and were they at least competitive. But in 2012, things took an unexpected turn when Mercedes, who had their F1 team from 2010 onwards, announced that Hamilton would be joining their ranks in 2013. --News24--
