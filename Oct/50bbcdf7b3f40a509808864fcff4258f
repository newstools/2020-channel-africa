The win in the cut down race gives the popular Hendrick Motorsports driver an automatic berth in the Cup playoffs’ Round of eight, which begins next weekend at Kansas Speedway. “Best way to get in the next round is to win,” Elliott said, “so hopefully we can do something with it.” Joining him in the next round will be Kurt Busch, Denny Hamlin, Kevin Harvick, Martin Truex Jr., Brad Keselowski, Joey Logano and Alex Bowman. “Great improvement for our road course program,” said Busch, who secured a Round of 8 berth when he won the first race of the three-race Round of 12. “Whether we were locked in or not, we came here to go for it.” Denny Hamlin won race number two of the Round of 12 and also was locked into the next round. Team Penske’s Logano finished second on Sunday while Erik Jones of Joe Gibbs Racing was third. Busch of Richard Childress racing was fourth while Penske’s Ryan Blaney was fifth. “We won our league. Nobody was beating that other car,” Logano said of Elliott. The victory at the CMS infield circuit was Elliott’s fourth straight on road courses. It allowed him to move into second place on the series’ list of consecutive road wins; he broke a tie with Tony Stewart and moved to within two of Jeff Gordon (six) atop the all-time list. --BBC--
