The home, which is near the capital Pretoria, is valued at R5.5 million ($350 000), according to local media. A magistrate had ordered them to hand over the title deed of the property when they were granted bail on charges of money laundering and fraud. The couple deny the charges. It emerged last week that they had fled to their home country of Malawi. The pastor said they had made a "tactical withdrawal" because they feared for their lives. South Africa has issued an arrest warrant for the couple, and wants Malawi to extradite them. --BBC--
