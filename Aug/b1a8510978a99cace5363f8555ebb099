The Deputy Justice Minister Filimao Suazi confirmed that the chemical was meant to come to Mozambique. But he denied that anyone in Mozambique was responsible for the explosion, instead pointing the finger at Beirut's port authorities. The ship, the MV Rhosus, had set out from Batumi, Georgia, in late September 2013, destined for Beira, in Mozambique. The document acknowledging receipt of cargo lists the customer as the International Bank of Mozambique, acting on behalf of a small Mozambique firm specialising in the manufacture of commercial explosives. But money troubles meant the ship stopped off at the port in Lebanon's capital Beirut to pick up more cargo to raise funds. But when the cargo - heavy rollers for building roads - was loaded the ship's deck hatches started to buckle causing a delay. During this delay, Lebanese authorities intervened. According to the Lloyd’s List intelligence database, the ship was eventually seized on February 4,2014, due to unpaid bills totalling $100,000. Some time later - it’s not clear when - the ship’s dangerous cargo was also removed. On August 4, 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate stored unsafely in a port warehouse detonated, killing more than 200 people. --BBC--
