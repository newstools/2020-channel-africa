The hospital has not responded to requests from the BBC for comment. The actor has now been buried under strict Covid-19 regulations at his rural home in the west of the country. His widow, Beatrice Ebbie Andega, revealed the details of his death. Bukeko, popularly known by his most famous screen name Papa Shirandula, died from breathing complications. Prior to falling ill, Andega said Bukeko had had a busy month and mingled with lots of people. Papa Shirandula was a burly, bubbly character in a long-running series by the same name on Kenyaâ€™s Citizen Television. So popular was Papa that he landed leading roles with worldwide brands like Coca Cola and FIFA among others. Dozens of current actors, many of whom have since landed jobs as prime-time radio presenters, credit Bukeko with kick starting their careers. --BBC--
