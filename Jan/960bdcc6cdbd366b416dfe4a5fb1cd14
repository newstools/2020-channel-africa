The head of the church in southern town of Nyendo where he was volunteering reported his kidnap on the evening of 2 January and a search for him began, police said. The police spokesperson alleges that a former colleague pretended to be his abductor and made a phone call demanding ransom. But then the missionary, along with a Ugandan, were arrested in a hideout, police spokesperson Fred Enanga said in a statement. "The suspects are being charged with conspiracy, giving false information and demanding by menaces," the police said. Neither suspects have commented on the allegations. --BBC--
