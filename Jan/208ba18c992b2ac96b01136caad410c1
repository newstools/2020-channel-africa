Justice Kossy Bor told the Transport Minister to constitute a team to oversee their provision, according to Business Daily newspaper. The team is expected to be composed of representatives from county governments and the road authorities. The case was filed by a lawyer who had argued that access to sanitary facilities was a basic right. In court, the county governments, through the council of governors, and the road authorities had traded blame over whose responsibility it was to provide the toilets. Travellers have in the past relied on toilets at hotel in towns along main roads. --BBC--
