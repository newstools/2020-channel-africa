April's borrowing of $75.80 billion was six times higher than in the same month last year and March's figure was revised up sharply to almost $18 billion as the government's emergency job-saving scheme began.

"We still think that public borrowing will equal about 15% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2020, greatly exceeding the 10% peak in the2008-to-09 recession even if a second virus wave is avoided, “Pantheon Macroeconomics economist Samuel Tombs said.
 
Public debt, including the Bank of England's massive bond-buying, jumped to nearly 98% of gross domestic product, reflecting higher borrowing and a lower estimate of the size of the economy based on a scenario by Britain's budget forecasters.  

That was the highest share of GDP by that measure since1963, the Office for National Statistics said. The ONS also said British retail sales fell by the most on record in April as much of the sector was shuttered by the government’s coronavirus lockdown.  

Sales volumes fell 18.1% in April from March, a slightly bigger fall than a median forecast for a drop of 16% in a Reuters poll of economists.

James Smith, an economist with ING, said there might not be a quick bounce-back for retailers when the lockdown is lifted.
