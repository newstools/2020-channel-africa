For the first time since World War II, there will be no Wimbledon after The Championships, along with a host of other tournaments, was cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic. Tennis officials are hopeful that the sport will resume by July 13, but Britain's players are eager to play some competitive matches before then. The Times reports Jamie Murray has been working behind the scenes to host an ATP Finals style event that will feature the top eight British male tennis players. The behind-closed-doors tournament will consist of two groups with a round-robin format and will also include a "handful of doubles teams". And to make sure those involved adhere to the social distancing rules, there will be no umpires with players calling shots out or in. The tournament is scheduled to take place from June 29 to July 12, taking up the original Wimbledon slot. --News24--
