It raises doubts that the race, due to make its debut in April before it was called off because of the coronavirus pandemic, will ever take place.

The date of the Vietnam race, April 25, has been left blank on a 22-race 2021 schedule to be published on Tuesday. The calendar could extend to 23 Grands Prix, a new record, if F1 can find a replacement for Vietnam.

The move has been triggered by the arrest on corruption charges of a key official responsible for the race in Hanoi.

Hanoi People's Committee chairman Nguyen Duc Chung was arrested in August for alleged appropriation of documents containing state secrets. The case is not related to his involvement in the grand prix.

However, Chung was the key figure in the race being introduced and championed it with the national government. His absence has led to a vacuum and Vietnamese authorities have told F1 that the government has other priorities, including key elections, the pandemic and recovery from a typhoon.

Talks are on-going with regard to a possible race in Vietnam in 2022, but the situation raises the significant possibility that the event will fail to materialise.

Any replacement race would be at one of the tracks added to the calendar in 2020 as a result of the pandemic, with Turkey, Italy's Imola and Portugal's Portimao the leading candidates.

A Spokesperson for F1 said: "Our calendar will be announced on Tuesday and we are not going to give a running commentary before its publication. It also needs to go to the FIA World Motor Sport Council for approval."

The 2021 season, the schedule for which has been seen by BBC Sport, is scheduled to start in Australia on March 21 and end in Abu Dhabi on December 5. 

The British Grand Prix at Silverstone is on July 18 and the new Saudi Arabian Grand Prix, announced last week, the penultimate race on November 28.
