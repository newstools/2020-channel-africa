The 24-year-old, who started in almost all of New Zealand's matches at the 2019 World Cup, said he was keen to stay with the All Blacks and Super Rugby's Chiefs. "I love playing rugby in New Zealand for me there is no better place I want to be, to develop on and off the field," he said in a statement. Lienert-Brown has played 43 Tests since his international debut in 2016 and his retention is a positive for the All Blacks, whose top players face the lure of lucrative offers from clubs in Europe and Japan. "For someone relatively young, he's been an outstanding and consistent player who I feel is getting better and better," All Blacks coach Ian Foster said.
