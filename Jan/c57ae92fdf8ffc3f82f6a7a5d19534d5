Taban Deng Gai also has created distrust that has inflamed conflict in South Sudan and undermined the peace process, the US Treasury Department said in a statement. Deng "reportedly arranged and directed the disappearance and deaths of human rights lawyer Samuel Dong Luak (Dong) and SPLM-IO member Aggrey Idry (Aggrey) in order to solidify his position within President Kiir's government and to intimidate members of the SPLM-IO," Treasury said. "Taban Deng Gai's attempt to silence the opposition party is derailing the country's ability to implement a peace agreement," Deputy Treasury Secretary, Justin Muzinich, said in a statement. "The US calls on all nations to exclude from the international financial system those who jeopardize South Sudan's future." Treasury sanctions freeze any cash or assets held in US territory and block access to the American financial system, which also typically impedes use of international banks that do business in the US.
