The 35-year-old has announced that he will retire from international cricket at the end of the ongoing England series and he will be heading up north for a stint with county side Somerset. Philander was superb in the first Test at Centurion with his 4/16 (14.2) in the first innings contributing massively towards a 107-run victory and South Africa taking a 1-0 lead in the four-match series. It was a reminder of exactly what the Test side will be missing when Philander leaves and his levels of skill, control and consistency were as impressive as ever. Now, Philander is ready to return home to Newlands where Cape Town has sold out the stadium for the first three days for what will be a send-off fitting of one of the best new ball bowlers South Africa has ever produced. "This has been a special place for me and I'm pretty sure that come the 3rd (of January) it will be emotional. This place has been good to me," he told media at the ground on Wednesday. "I started here in 2003 so it's 17 years of playing at this wonderful venue. "When you come in here you still see the same faces from 2003 coming I to support us, and I think that's wonderful. There is no better place to be playing your cricket."
