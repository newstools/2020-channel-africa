The dollar was hurt by the stall in fiscal stimulus talks, although an upbeat US inflation reading supported follow-through Treasury selling, building on a better-than-expected PPI release earlier this week. Headline and core inflation both rose by 0.6% m-o-m in July, while the y-o-y trend for headline CPI picked up to a 1.0% pace from 0.6%in June. While consumer prices are rebounding from the pandemic shock, there is still a long way to go to a full recovery. Further, inflation will not sustainably achieve the Fedâ€™s 2% y-o-y target until a vaccine or therapeutic is found and virus fears have faded. At the close of local trade, the rand quoted 1.07% stronger at R17.36/$, after trading in range of R17.34/$ - R17.57/$. Expected range today R17.20/$ - R17.55/$. --iol--
