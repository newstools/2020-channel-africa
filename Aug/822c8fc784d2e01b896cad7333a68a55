It is the worst in the last 10 years since 2010, comparative analysis has shown. The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for the second quarter of 2020 released on Monday by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed that the latest GDP contraction ended the 3-year trend of low but positive real growth rates recorded since the 2016/2017 recession. According to a Bloomberg report, with the COVID-19 pandemic, economists had predicted about 4 % negative growth for Nigeria. However, the NBS report revealed it was higher than this. This was coming days after a report on the unemployment rate showed 21.7 million Nigerians were unemployed. The NBS largely attributed the economic contraction to "significantly lower levels of both domestic and international economic activity during the quarter, which resulted from nationwide shutdown efforts aimed at containing the COVID-19 pandemic." The apex statistical body in Nigeria said the domestic efforts ranged from initial restrictions of human and vehicular movement implemented in only a few states to a nationwide curfew, bans on domestic and international travel, closure of schools and markets among others, affecting both local and international trade. "The efforts, led by both the federal and state governments, evolved over the course of the quarter and persisted throughout," the NBS said in the report. Daily Trust analysis showed that compared to the second quarter of 2019 when the growth rate was 2.12 %, that of 2020 dropped by -8.22 %. It is a fall of -7.97 % compared to first quarter (Q1) of 2020, which was 1.87 % growth rate. For Q1 of 2020, real GDP declined by -2.18 %, compared with 2.11% recorded in the first half of 2019.  --AllAfrica--
