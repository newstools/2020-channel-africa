Prosecutors said Huawei had violated the terms of partnerships with US companies and stolen trade secrets such as source code and robot technology. It adds to a list of other charges brought by the US in 2019. Those accused Huawei of violating US sanctions and stealing technology from T-Mobile. Huawei has denied the claims. The firm, one of the world's biggest smartphone makers, said the US is targeting it because its expansion is a threat to American business interests. Meng Wanzhou, its Chief Financial Officer and the daughter of the company's founder, is still being held in Canada where she is fighting extradition to the US. She is wanted there on charges of fraud and sanctions violations, claims she denies. "This new indictment is part of the Justice Department's attempt to irrevocably damage Huawei's reputation and its business for reasons related to competition rather than law enforcement," the company said. In the updated indictment, the US accuses Huawei of racketeering and trade secret theft, and gives more detail about the firm's efforts to evade US rules on doing business with Iran and North Korea.
