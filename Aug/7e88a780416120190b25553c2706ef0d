Nenzani resigned less than a month before he was due to step down at next month’s annual general meeting. He served two three-year terms and his contract was supposed to expire last year, but he was asked to serve another year. In his last 12 months as President, CSA has been embroiled in one controversy after the other – both on and off the field. The deadline for the release of an independent report into suspended Chief Executive Officer(CEO), Thabang Moroe, wasn’t met and parts of the report have yet to be made public. The Proteas had a disastrous year on the field and although CSA came out in support of the Black Lives Matter movement recently, there still seems to be profound levels of racism in South African cricket.
