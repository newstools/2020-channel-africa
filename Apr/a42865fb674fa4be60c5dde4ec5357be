The COVID-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc on the sporting schedule and golf is no exception. In fact, with the nature of players having to travel to a different destination each weekend, the future of gold is uncertain. Pelley alluded to these issues in a recent email, which was revealed by The Telegraph. "The infrastructure of tournaments could look radically different from what you have been used to," said Pelley. "Many of the things you have become accustomed to, such as top-class players' lounges or courtesy car services will most likely assume a different appearance, if indeed they are present at all. "Prize funds will also most likely be different. The reality is, the pandemic is going to have a profound impact on the tour financially, as well as many of our partners, both in sponsorship and broadcast areas." Pelley added that they are looking at several options to cram in as much of the tournament schedule as possible should the season resume. So far, 14 events have been cancelled or postponed altogether. --News24--
