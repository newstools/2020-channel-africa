The military base, Camp Simba, is in the popular coastal region of Lamu and is used by Kenyan and US forces for training and counter-terrorism operations. One US military service member and two contractors were killed in the attack. The US army officials were briefed about "details of the attack" and "assessed the situation" at the camp, according to a statement by Gen Stephen Townsend, the commander of US Africa Command. An unspecified number of US soldiers have already been deployed to secure the military base. --BBC--
