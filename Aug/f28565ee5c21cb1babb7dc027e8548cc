The world’s top producer of motor fuel from coal said its headline loss per share is expected to be between $0.4949 in the year to June 30. Sasol said lower global chemical and refining margins and an 18% decrease in the rand per barrel price of Brent crude oil had hurts earnings. Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation are also expected to fall by as much as 37% to between $2 billion to $3 billion. The company said it had recorded impairments in some of its cash generating units after a weakening economy and the fair value impact of starting discussions to find a partner for its United States (US) Base Chemicals assets. Sasol has embarked on a review of its assets and set out to find a partner at its US Base Chemicals operations in an effort to avoid a potential $2 billion rights issue after a slump in the oil price and the impact of the new coronavirus weighed on the company’s ability to pay its debt. Investors have been concerned by the company’s debt, largely due to delays and cost overruns at its Lake Charles Chemicals project in Louisiana that forced its former joint-Chief Executive Officers to resign in a bid to restore shareholder confidence. Sasol is expected to release its full-year results on August 17. --Reuters--
