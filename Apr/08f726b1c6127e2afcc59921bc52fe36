The doctor was admitted to Lagos University Teaching Hospital on Monday and died on Wednesday, according to the hospital's director, Chris Bode. Bode said the doctor was brought to the hospital with severe symptoms. The Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) said the deceased, Dr Chugbo Emeka, was exposed while managing a patient who died on Friday. The association is quoted by Vanguard newspaper as saying that the 51-year-old doctor was asthmatic. The NMA has in the past urged the state governments to provide enough protective gear to all health workers. The association urged patients to be honest about their medical, travel and contact history to help doctors quickly identify a potential coronavirus case. --BBC--
