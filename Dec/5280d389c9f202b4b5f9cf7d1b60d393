On-going talks in central London are expected to go late into Thursday evening, the BBC's Europe editor says. The two sides are urgently seeking compromises in key areas before current trading rules expire at the end of December. Fishing rights, competition rules and how an agreement should be enforced remain outstanding issues. The two sides have been locked in talks since March to determine their future relations once the UK's Brexit transition periods ends on December 31. Ireland's foreign affairs minister Simon Coveney told Irish broadcaster RTE on Thursday that talks were "at the very end". Speaking ahead of Brexit meetings in Paris with his French counterpart, he said efforts were under way to close negotiations "in the next few days". Boris Johnson has said the UK remains "absolutely committed" to "getting a deal if we can". Speaking on Wednesday, the Prime Minister said the EU side "know what the UK bottom line is," as talks continued in what is seen as a crucial week. Negotiators got back to work in London on Thursday morning - face-to-face talks have been on-going since the weekend after a week-long pause.
