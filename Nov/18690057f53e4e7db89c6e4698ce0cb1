This follows the opening of new bookings for Comair’s low-cost carrier kulula.com earlier this month ahead of its planned take off again on December 1, 2020. Comair on Monday said that British Airways plans to begin serving all its domestic routes it previously operated. However, regional services will be reintroduced as it ramps up to full operations over the next few months. Rescue consortium representative Glenn Orsmond said Comair customers can now book either of its airline brands, with the option of booking in business class. “With reservations for the British Airways’ flights open we’re now able to offer bookings on a considerably expanded schedule,” Orsmond said. “British Airways’ on-going support is a huge vote of confidence in the future of Comair.” Orsmond reiterated that Comair will initially operate a fleet of 15 aircraft across both airline brands gradually increasing as the remainder of the fleet returns to service over the next few months. The reintroduction of British Airways’ flights will also see the reopening of the popular slow lounges. Initially the domestic lounges at King Shaka International, Cape Town International and OR Tambo International will open. The other lounges will reopen as the flight schedule expands. Comair’s shares were suspended from trading at the JSE after the vast majority of its creditors and investors voted in favour of placing it under business rescue in May. --IOL--
