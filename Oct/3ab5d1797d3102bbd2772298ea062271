Amazon and Apple have surged 74% and 57%, respectively, this year, far outperforming the S&P 500’s 5% gain as the coronavirus pandemic accelerates trends toward online shopping, video streaming and other technologies helping Wall Street’s largest companies take market share from smaller rivals. Big Tech for years has been criticized for choking competition and stifling smaller competitors, and investors are looking for signs that they are extending their lead during the pandemic. However, antitrust storm clouds in recent months have increased. A scathing report by a House of Representatives panel this month detailing abuses of market power by large tech companies suggests a tough road ahead should Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, who is leading in polls, win the November 3 election. “There seems to be a lot of angst and desire to not only fine these companies, but potentially change the way they do their business. In the past, there was a lot of lip service, but now you are starting to see some pretty active postures,” said Dan Morgan, a portfolio manager at Synovus Trust. Morgan said he expects to see companies set money aside to pay for potential future fines.
