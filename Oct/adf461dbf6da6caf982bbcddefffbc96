The project is set to benefit from the vast experience of EgyptAir, as the oldest African air carrier and as the Egyptian flag carrier provides services to more than 80 destinations around the world. Egyptian Ambassador to Accra Emad Hanna took part in the signing ceremony. EgyptAir Board Chairperson, Rushdi Zakaria, asserted the importance of boosting co-operation and exchanging expertise with the states of the African continent in the different domains including air transport. Zakaria pointed out to the depth of historical ties between Egypt and Ghana, asserting the ability of EgyptAir to support cooperation between both countries in the field of civil aviation and meet the logistics needs to establish a strong aviation company capable of competing in the international market and achieving the strategic targets of both sides. In September, EgyptAir announced its cooperation with ASTER hospitals in Dubai and other northern UAE emirates for EgyptAir passengers coming from the UAE to Cairo to undergo PCR tests. This falls within the framework of EgyptAirâ€™s keenness to offer the best services to its clients, especially during the time of the coronavirus.  --EgyptToday--
