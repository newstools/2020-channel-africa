The World Food Programme is planning to double the number of Zimbabweans that it assists to 4.1 million, but says it will require over $200 million at current exchange rates) to meet its needs in the first half of 2020 alone. “As things stand, we will run out of food by end of February, coinciding with the peak of the hunger season – when needs are at their highest,” said Niels Balzer, WFP’s Deputy Country Director in Zimbabwe, in a statement. “Firm pledges are urgently needed as it can take up to three months for funding commitments to become food on people’s tables.” To meet the increasing hunger needs of the population, the WFP was forced to launch an emergency 'lean season' assistance programme in August, months earlier than expected. The country is likely to face another below average harvest in 2020 following poor rainfall. Hilal Elver, the UN Special Rapporteur on the right to food, visited Zimbabwe in November where she witnessed how women and children are bearing the brunt of the crisis. “In a desperate effort to find alternative means of livelihood, some women and children are resorting to coping mechanisms that violate their most fundamental human rights and freedoms. As a result, school drop-outs, early marriage, domestic violence, prostitution and sexual exploitation are on the rise throughout Zimbabwe,” she said in a statement following her 11-day mission.
