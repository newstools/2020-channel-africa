Comoros' President Azali Assoumani said the patient is a man who came in contact with a French-Comorian national who'd recently travelled to France before being hospitalised on Â April 23. His condition is improving and the authorities are tracing those who came into contact with him, President Assoumani said. Lesotho is the only remaining African country that hasn't reported any cases. There have been reports of people dying from "respiratory distress" in Comoros, but the president last week said no case had been registered in the country's three islands. --bbc--
