Miskine, founder and head of the Democratic Front of the Central African People (FDPC), was offered a government position under the terms of the February 2019 accord. However, in the last report by UN experts monitoring sanctions and an arms embargo imposed in 2013, the self-proclaimed general was mentioned as looking for fighters. Despite the signing of the agreement, Miskine "remains a threat to the peace, stability and security of the CAR," a diplomat said. Miskine had signed the peace agreement in Khartoum between CAR President Faustin-Archange Touadera and the heads of 14 armed groups. Under the deal, militia chiefs were given senior government positions in the purported aim of helping to cement peace. Miskine was named as an adviser to the new government but never took up his post, according to Bangui. In November 2019, the Central African government said Miskine had been arrested in neighbouring Chad and demanded his extradition. --News24--
