Prosus said it would implement the share buyback by the acquisition of up to $1.4 billion of its own shares and $3.6 billion of Naspersâ€™. The move came on the back of a 32% rise in revenue for the six months to end September for the two companies. Prosus said this revenue shot to $12.7 billion, with strong growth reported across food delivery, up by 141%, while retail revenue increased by 70% and education revenue inched up by 54%. Its trading profit surged 43% to $2.7 billion and core headline earnings increased 29% to $2.2 billion, driven by improved profitability from its ecommerce units and the growing contribution from Tencent. Prosus free cash flow jumped from $14 million to $370 million, driven by lower food losses, strong working-capital management and a $81million increase in Tencent dividend. Naspers revenue increased to $13 billion, supported by 141% on food delivery, 69% increase in e-tail and 54% in ed-tech. Its trading profit increased 42% to $2.6 billion and core headline earnings were marginally up to $1.6 billion, driven by improved profitability from its ecommerce units and the growing contribution from Tencent. The group said the year-on-year 5% decrease reflects that it owns 72.66% of Prosus compared to 100% a year earlier. Naspers free cash flow surged to $292 million compared to $19 million last year, also driven by the same factors as Prosus. Chief Executive Bob van Dijk said the performance reflected resilience and adaptability to navigate through challenging times. --IOL--
