McLaren’s Spaniard Carlos Sainz chased Gasly across the line at a spectator-free Monza deprived of its usual atmosphere by the COVID-19 pandemic, with Racing Point’s Lance Stroll completing a youthful podium. Mercedes’s championship leader Lewis Hamilton finished seventh after starting on pole, leading and dropping to last following a 10-second stop/go penalty for entering the pit lane under a red light during the first of two safety car deployments. Despite the setback, the six-times world champion fought back and retained his 47-point lead at the top, now over team mate Valtteri Bottas, who made a dismal start and was fifth. Hamilton, who equalled a Formula One record with his 41st successive classified finish and took a bonus point for fastest lap, has 164 points after eight races to Bottas’s 117. Red Bull’s Max Verstappen, previously Hamilton’s closest rival, retired with mechanical problems and dropped to third on 110 points. It was the first time since 2013, when Kimi Raikkonen triumphed with Lotus in Australia, that a team other than Mercedes, Ferrari or Red Bull had won a race. “It’s unbelievable,” gasped Gasly, who was demoted by Red Bull’s main team last year in a switch with Alexander Albon but has come on in strides in a season disrupted by COVID-19 and without spectators. “It was such a crazy race and we capitalised on it. I’ve been through so much in 18 months, I struggle to realise this,” added the 24-year-old of his first F1 win. The victory was also the first by a French driver since Olivier Panis in 1996 and the second for the former Toro Rosso team whose only other win was also at Monza with Sebastian Vettel in 2008. “I was so close but yet so far,” said Sainz, who had also dreamed of taking his first win before joining Ferrari next year. “I needed one more lap.” --Reuters--
