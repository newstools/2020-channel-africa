Brent was down 80 cents, or 1.9%, at $40.97 by 1121 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) dropped 82 cents, or 2.1%, to $39.03. Both contracts fell almost 2.5% last week. The US reported its highest number yet of new coronavirus infections in two days through Saturday, while in France new cases hit a record of more than 50 000 on Sunday. 

Italy and Spain imposed fresh restrictions to curb the virus. The rising number of cases “not only highlight the risks posed by immediate transport restrictions, but also dampen long-term demand expectations,” said Commerzbank analyst Eugen Weinberg. On the supply side, Libya’s National Oil Corp (NOC) said it had lifted force majeure on the El-Feel oil field. NOC said on Friday Libyan production would reach one million barrels per day (bpd) in coming weeks, a quicker ramp-up than many analysts had predicted. “In an environment where there are renewed worries over the demand outlook, the last thing the market needs right now is additional supply,” said Warren Patterson, ING’s head of commodities strategy. OPEC+, the group of producers including the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia, is also set to increase output by two million bpd in January 2021 after cutting production by a record amount earlier in 2020. “OPEC+ must not be careless and have to address the issue of the extra barrels appearing in the market, otherwise the days of relatively stable oil prices will be numbered,” said oil broker PVM’s Tamas Varga. --Reuters--
