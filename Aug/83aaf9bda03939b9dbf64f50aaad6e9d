About 963 000 people sought the benefits last week, down from nearly 1.2 million the week before, the Labour Department said. The figures have been subsiding since peaking at 6.9 million in late March 2020. But they remain extremely high, driving debate in Washington over the need for further stimulus. More than 28 million people, nearly one in five American workers, were still collecting benefits in the week ended July 25, the Labour Department said. Prior to the pandemic, the highest number of new jobless claims recorded in a week were 695 000, set in 1982. "Another larger-than-expected decline in jobless claims suggests that the jobs recovery is regaining some momentum but with a staggering 28 million workers still claiming some form of jobless benefits, much labour market progress remains to be done," said Lydia Boussour, Senior United States (US) Economist at Oxford Economics. Hiring in the US slowed last month as the country struggled to contain the coronavirus, with employers adding 1.8 million jobs, down from 4.8 million in June. The unemployment rate was 10.2%, down from April's 14.7% but still higher the 10% peak during the 2007-2009 financial crisis. --BBC--
