Cocoa futures on ICE are near their highest in three years, driven in part by overly dry, hot winds, which have also damaged the crop in neighbouring Ivory Coast, the world’s top cocoa producer. Four local traders and exporters, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they see the 2019/20 Ghanaian crop at 790 000-820 000 tons, a shortfall that if realised could help drive global prices higher. It is well short of an 875 000 consensus forecast in a Reuters poll in late January. A source at Ghanaian cocoa regulator Cocobod said the weather is a major concern but declined to discuss numbers. “It has not been raining for more than four months and the heat is so strong there are very few flowers, cherelles (young cocoa pods) and pods in the fields,” said an Accra-based exporter. In 2018/19, Ghanaian cocoa output totalled 815 000 tons, according to the International Cocoa Organisation, far below the international body’s initial projection of 900 000 tons issued in February 2019. The ICCO is expected to publish its first projections for 2019/20 crops later this month. Some analysts question the extent to which this season’s Ghanaian crop will miss consensus forecasts. “People have been reducing their numbers but not by 50 000 tons. Arrivals so far have been quite good and at this stage, there’s only the mid crop and tail-end of the main crop left,” an analyst at a major chocolate maker said. Cocoa arrivals at Ghanaian ports stood at 596 000 tons from October 1, the start of the season, until January 16, up from 591 000 tons the same period of the previous season, official figures show. But local exporters are concerned. The director of a European company based in Accra said production will disappoint as the recent dry spell has reduced the crop. “We have been forced to lower our predictions,” he said. Ghana and Ivory Coast produce more than 60% of the world’s cocoa. Both countries’ output has been hit by the weather, but the situation in Ivory Coast is more severe as farmers and middlemen there have been hoarding in anticipation of higher prices next season, a Europe-based trader said. Ivory Coast and Ghana have introduced a $400 a ton living income differential or premium for their 2020/21 cocoa sales in a bid to guarantee higher prices for farmers and combat pervasive poverty. It is difficult to hoard in Ghana as the market is so tightly controlled by the government, the Europe-based trader said. --Reuters--
