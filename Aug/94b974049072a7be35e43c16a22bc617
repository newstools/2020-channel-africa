SAA has around 4 600 employees. Now, more than 3 146 of them want to leave the company. 

These include more than half of management, over 600 pilots, two-thirds of cabin crew and almost the entire ground staff. “Most of the workers are taking decisions based on the fact that they have to survive more than anything. I can assure you that most of the workers who have applied for Voluntary Severance Packages are not doing so because they want to go, they are seeing that they have to choose between the survival and something which they know cannot come up. “So, it’s about their families, it’s about meeting their financial obligations and the number is overwhelming,” says President of the National Transport Movement, Mashudu Raphetha. The National Transport Movement is a splinter union from the South African Transport and Allied Workers Union. According to SAA’s Business Rescue Plan, 2 700 workers are earmarked for Voluntary Severance Packages. That means, not all the 3 146 applications will be approved. And still, the government is yet to raise the money needed to fund the Voluntary Severance Packages and the entire Business Rescue Plan which is set to cost around $57 billion. Raphetha says the delay in finding the money is a cause for concern to the unions. “We are very much worried; we were hoping that that money would have been availed by now.” --SABC--
