The 24th to 27th event will run under the theme: "2020-2030: A decade to deliver a transformed and Prosperous Africa through the 2030 Agenda and 2063 Agenda." 

Since the adoption of the 2030 Agenda in 2015, five sessions of the Forum have been held with the last one hosted by Morocco in 2019. This is meant to allow member countries to review their own progress with regards the achievement of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals as well learn from other countries the best practices.
