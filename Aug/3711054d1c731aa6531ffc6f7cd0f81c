Japan's Naomi Osaka tops the list with earnings of $37.4 million, ahead of Serena Williams with $36 million. World number one, Ashleigh Barty, is third with income of $13.1 million. US international footballer, Alex Morgan, is the only athlete from outside tennis in the top 10, earning $4.6 million. Morgan, who gave birth to her first child in May, earned $4.2 million of her income through endorsements during the span of Forbes analysis, between 1 June 2019 and 1 June 2020. The US women's team, winners of the Women's World Cup in July 2019, are currently in dispute with their federation, appealing against a judge's decision to reject their claims of being underpaid compared with the US men's team. Osaka and Williams have both broken the previous record for annual earnings, set at $29.7 million in 2015 by Russian tennis player Maria Sharapova. In a list of the world's 100 best-paid sportspeople published by Forbes in May, Osaka (29th) and Williams (33rd) were the only women. --BBC--
