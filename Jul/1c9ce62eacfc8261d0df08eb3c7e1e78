Fish, who was an integral part of the national side that clinched the 1996 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) title on home soil, was asked by a Twitter user why he liked the tweet, to which he responded: "All Lives Matter...!!" Soon afterwards, Fish commented in a post of his own: "If you stand for nothing you will fall for everything....All Lives Matter." The former Bolton Wanderers and Charlton Athletic centre-back then added that he was "certainly not a racist" for proclaiming 'All Lives Matter' and asked his Twitter followers "when will we move forward". The tweets read (sic): "Sorry to offend many people...I certainly am not a racist but I am a firm believer in all people matter so all lives matter. "No matter our past...focus on today and the future....if you don’t stand for something you will always fall for everything...have a fantastic evening !! "So in my life I have seen#sira,I have seen #sa and then the Jews in...and everyone wants to tell me about #bFL...we have experienced the world but when will we move forward...yesterday,today or tomorrow...all lives matter. "I see my inbox of a lot of hate but always know...all lives matter ...know matter where we come from!" South African sporting codes, in particular cricket and rugby, made headlines in the past two weeks following Proteas fast bowler Lungi Ngidi's stance on the Black Lives Matter movement. "It's definitely something I believe we would be addressing as a team," Ngidi said after he was named SA's men's ODI and T20 Cricketer-of-the-Year at the annual CSA awards. "And if we're not, it's obviously something that I would bring up. It's something that we need to take seriously, like the rest of the world is doing. We need to make a stand." Ngidi, true to his word, took a knee in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement before the start of last weekend's Solidarity Cup at SuperSport Park in Centurion. He was also joined by all the players, staff and umpires, including Cricket South Africa (CSA) director of cricket Graeme Smith and former Proteas bowler Makhaya Ntini, who also recently spoke out about how he was treated in the Proteas camp during his playing days. Earlier this week, Springbok captain, Siya Kolisi also added his voice to the Black Lives Matter movement with a lengthy video where he opens up about racism. --news24-- So in my life I have seen#sira,I have seen #sa and then the Jews in...and everyone wants to tell me about #bFL...we have experienced the world but when will we move forward...yesterday,today or tomorrow...all lives matterð
