Activists shared videos of the man's body found in Mathare area with a gunshot wound and called for an end to police brutality. The hashtag #JusticeForVaite was a top trend on Twitter. One activist, Boniface Mwangi, said the man worked at a local market and used to sleep on the streets. Human Rights Watch in April condemned police brutality in Kenya at the beginning of the dusk-to-dawn curfew. The watchdog at the time said six people had been killed in the first 10 days of the curfew. --BBC--
