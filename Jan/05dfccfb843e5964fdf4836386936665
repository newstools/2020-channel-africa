The announcement came just days after senior officials in the ruling party called for Prime Minister, Thomas Thabane, to resign, accusing him of obstructing the investigation into the killing. Lipolelo Thabane was gunned down by unknown assailants on the outskirts of the capital Maseru in June 2017, two days before her husband's inauguration. In a letter that only became public in court documents this week, Lesotho's Police Chief, Holomo Molibeli, asked the Prime Minister to answer questions regarding his estranged wife's killing. Thabane subsequently tried to suspend him but went back on his decision this week after Molibeli challenged it in court. Thabane's current wife, Maesaiah Thabane, was summoned for questioning on Friday to "shed some light into the ongoing investigations", Deputy Police Commissioner, Paseka Mokete, told AFP. "We got at the State House at around 12 midday on Friday but were denied access by the guards at the gate," Mokete told AFP on Saturday. "When we were allowed entry she was nowhere to be found." A court subsequently issued a warrant for her arrest, he added. Attorney General, Haae Phoofolo, later told police that Maesaiah Thabane would be handed over on Monday. Phoofolo did not respond to requests for comment. --News24--
