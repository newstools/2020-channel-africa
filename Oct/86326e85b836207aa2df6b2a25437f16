Police manned roadblocks on the main bridges across the Nile as well as on roads leading to army headquarters, the site of a long-running protest camp during the unrest that led to the ouster of long-time President Omar al-Bashir in April 2019. Vehicles carrying armed soldiers deployed across the city, an AFP correspondent reported. "We apologise to the people of Khartoum State for the impact of closing the city's bridges as a precaution, from midnight Tuesday until Wednesday evening," the state government said. The government said it was closing the roads as a precaution against protests meant to commemorate Sudan’s revolutionary path. On one hand, protesters were seeking to mark the first popular revolution since Sudan's independence in 1951 against a totalitarian regime that broke out on October 21, 1964, and toppled former president Ibrahim Abboud. It has since become a point of reference for subsequent revolutions. Some political parties and trade unions that originally supported it have often demanded to mark the day every year. On the other hand, supporters of the current transitional government under Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok, and those in support of the regime of ousted president Omar al-Bashir had turned up in central Khartoum. Security forces demanded they clear from the streets as they shut down main roads. The Sudanese Professionals Association, a trade union alliance that spearheaded the protests against Bashir, had called for fresh demonstrations against economic conditions that have continued to deteriorate since his overthrow. --TheEastAfrican--
