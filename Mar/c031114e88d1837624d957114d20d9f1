Debre Medhanit Slase Cheleqo is the church in northern Ethiopia that had originally housed it. It's believed the crown was given to the church by feudal lord Ras Weldeselassie hundreds of years ago. The crown was returned to Ethiopia last month following a campaign by Ethiopian Sirak Asfaw who discovered it in the suitcase of a visitor in 1998. Church priests told BBC Tigrinya that they wanted the artefact back in its rightful place rather than being put in a museum in Addis Ababa. Their wish was granted. On Wednesday, hundreds of people from Mekelle and surrounding areas flocked to Alula Aba Nega International Airport to welcome the crown home. --BBC--
