Taiwan has signed an agreement with Somaliland to “establish good relations” and that the two countries “share a deep-seated love of freedom & democracy,” Wu wrote on Twitter. Taiwan has formal diplomatic relations with only 15 countries due to pressure from China, which considers the island to be its territory with no right to state-to-state ties. Somaliland is a self-declared state internationally recognised only as an autonomous region of Somalia. It is strategically located on the Horn of Africa on the shores of the Gulf of Aden, facing war-torn Yemen. --Reuters--
