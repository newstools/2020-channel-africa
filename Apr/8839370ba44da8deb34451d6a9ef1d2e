Almost all the major S&P 500 sub-sectors fell more than 1%, with the energy index .SPNY sliding for the seventh time in eight sessions a day after the WTI contract CLc1 crashed below zero as oil traders ran out of storage for May deliveries. With the collapse spilling into June futures contracts, investors turned fearful about the extent of the economic damage from sweeping lockdown measures that have halted business activity and sparked millions of layoffs. “Yesterday, the historic oil crash had a limited impact on US stocks, but that won’t be the case going forward as the rolling of contracts won’t wait so close to expiry,” said Edward Moya, market analyst at OANDA. “Oil prices will remain heavy in the short-term and since many energy stocks have recently rebounded, they are ripe to see a lot of pain this week.” The benchmark S&P 500 index .SPX has climbed over 25% from a March low, powered by trillions of dollars in stimulus, but still remained nearly 17% below its record high as entire countries shut down to try to contain the virus. US jobless claims hit 22 million in the past month as Corporate America launched dramatic cost-saving measures to ride out the slump, and readings of US business activity surveys, due Thursday, are likely to plummet to recession-era lows. The financials index .SPSY fell 1.9% as the flight from risk sent investors scurrying to the perceived safety of bonds and the dollar. --Reuters--
