A police spokesperson said her death is being treated as unexplained but not suspicious. Refugee charity Positive Action in Housing said Baguma had claimed asylum and lived in "extreme poverty". It said she lost her job after her right to work in the UK expired. Her son was found next to his mother, crying and "weakened from several days of starvation" according to Robina Qureshi, director of Positive Action in Housing. The boy was taken to hospital and discharged on August 24, and is now staying with his father. --BBC--
