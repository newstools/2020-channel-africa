World number one Novak Djokovic said in April he "wouldn't want to be forced to take a vaccine to be able to travel". But Murray hopes players would "do that for the good of the sport, providing everything has proved to be safe". "I'm confident that players would be into it if it meant the tour going back to normality," said the Briton, 33. "I guess we're not going to know the long-term effects potentially for a while. But what I've been hearing on the TV and on the news is that there shouldn't really be any long-term effects." Djokovic, who tested positive for Covid-19 in June, accepted he would have a difficult decision to make should taking the vaccine ever become a condition of entry to tournaments. "I also read - a few weeks after he'd said he wouldn't be keen on doing that - that if it was something that had to be done for him to play the sport, he would," Murray said. "I guess we'll have to wait and see what the ATP and the ITF decide." Murray is currently training and preparing for an unexpected Christmas at home with his family. The former world number one had been planning to fly to Melbourne in the middle of December, to quarantine ahead of the Australian Open, but the Premier of Victoria has blocked players arriving before the end of December 2020 at the very earliest. As a result, Murray has been told the first Grand Slam of the season may be delayed.
