The country has also recorded 115 new COVID-19 related fatalities, pushing the death toll to 21 083. In a statement, Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize says most of the new deaths were recorded in the Eastern Cape. “Regrettably, 115 more COVID-19 related deaths have been reported: Eastern Cape 45, Free State 20, Gauteng 19, KwaZulu-Natal 10, Northern Cape 5 and Western Cape 16. This brings the total to 21 083,” reads Recoveries now stand at 716 444, which translates to a recovery rate of 92.8%. While there is concern over the spike in cases in the Eastern Cape, all South Africans have been urged to continue adhering to COVID-19 safety protocols as the festive season approaches. “A resurgence at any scale will not just dramatically reverse our health gains. It will choke the green shoots of economic recovery that have emerged, and take us back from spring to winter,” President Cryil Ramaphosa warned the public in his weekly newsletter to the nation early in November.
