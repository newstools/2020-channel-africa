The campaign group, Human Rights Watch, says there have been reports of at least three deaths at the facility in Riyadh, where people are crammed into overcrowded and unsanitary rooms. Most of the detainees were arrested because they didn't have residency permits, and they're expected to be deported. The authorities haven't yet responded to the allegations of ill-treatment. In October, rights activists reported migrants being forced to endure similarly dire conditions at detention facilities elsewhere in Saudi Arabia. --BBC--
