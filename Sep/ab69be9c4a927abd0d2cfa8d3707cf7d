The party says National Treasury had not made a commitment to cut budgets or redirect cash to fund any South African Airways (SAA, bailout.

South Africa’s opposition party Democratic Alliance (DA) Member of Parliament Alf Lees has challenged both the BRPs and Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan to produce the letter of commitment if they dispute his assertion.   

He says it is astounding that there can be any consideration of budget cuts in other departments to fund SAA when South Africa had to borrow money from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) just to cope with the economic meltdown caused by government’s COVID-19 lockdown.    

“It seems clear that the reason that the BRPs refused to make the letter from “the Government” public was because it does not stipulate that Minister Tito Mboweni and National Treasury had agreed to move money from other budgeted expenditure in order to make $63 billion available to SAA. We believe that Minister Gordhan and the SAA BRPs were being obtuse and misled South Africans,” says Lees.    

On Friday, the airlines’ BRPs confirmed receiving a letter from the department and Treasury making a commitment to provide the $63 billion funding needed to restructure SAA.     
--SABC-- Tito Mboweni has accepted defeat in the battle to stop any further bailout of SAA. The confirmation by Gordhan that SAA will be bailed out again represents a crushing defeat for Mboweni’s fight to stop any further bailouts for the airline - @geordinhl https://t.co/lLXbObx00A
