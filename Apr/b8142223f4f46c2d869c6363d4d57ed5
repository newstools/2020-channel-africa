A statement from US Africa Command (Africom) says two civilians were "regrettably and unintentionally" killed and three were injured during the incident in February. It says the same attack killed two members of the Islamist militant group, al-Shabab. Amnesty International says the airstrike killed a banana farmer and an employee of a telecoms company. It says over the last year more than 20 Somali civilians have been killed during air strikes. The US military denies this. Africom says by the end of May a website will be available that will allow people to register allegations of any civilian casualties. --BBC--
