The 39-year-old will work with manager Gernot Rohr and replaces Imama Amapakabo in the technical crew of the three-times African champions. “I’m super excited about the opportunity,” Yobo, who played for Marseille, Everton and Fenerbahce during his club career, told ESPN. “It’s not something I was expecting so it came as a bit of a surprise, but when the opportunity came I had to grab it. And that’s what makes it so special because I wasn’t chasing it.” Former defender, Yobo earned the first of his 100 caps against Zambia in 2001 and went on to feature in the 2002, 2010 and 2014 World Cups. --Reuters--
