The telco, which marked its 20th anniversary in October, has seen exponential growth and now is looking to innovation to simplify its products and services in line with its future strategy. The chief executive Peter Ndegwa said the company will continue to be purpose-led as it transforms into a technology company. Safaricom has since grown to become the leading telco in the country, with 65 % of the market share under its grip. “We started as a mobile company, we have evolved and combined technology and innovation to really transform lives. We want to be a purpose-led technology company but the foundation of that is to be customer-obsessed,” said Ndegwa. The CEO said the company will improve more on transparency especially on data to customers, an area he acknowledged has been problematic. He added that the company is cognizant of the fact that technology and a data-driven economy can further support Kenya’s economic growth and that will be the company’s launchpad for the next 20 years. --TheEastAfrican--
