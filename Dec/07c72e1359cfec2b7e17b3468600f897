About 800 pupils were enrolled at the Government Science Secondary School for boys in Kankara town. "We increased our deployment in the whole of that area where we have some volunteered information about them," Army Spokesperson, Major General John Enenche, also told the BBC. Earlier, the Nigerian Presidential Spokesperson, Garba Shehu, said he believed just 10 children were still being held. Many may simply have fled. Enenche told the BBC that lot of students "ran out of the school into the surroundings. Of course the bandits still went ahead to kidnap some of them". Armed groups often kidnap people for ransom in north-western Nigeria. But so far no group has claimed responsibility for the attack on Friday, or demanded ransom. --BBC--
