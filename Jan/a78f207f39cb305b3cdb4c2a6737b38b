Ministers from Egypt, Tunisia, Sudan, Chad, Mali and Niger will visit Algiers a week after a summit in Berlin aimed at shoring up a ceasefire. Algeria, which has a 1000 kilometres border with Libya, is working to “build consensus to secure the maximum chance for a peace deal” at a proposed future meeting in Algiers, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. Algeria maintains good contacts with all sides in Libya. Several other foreign leaders and foreign ministers from Arab and European states and Turkey have all visited Algeria in recent weeks to discuss the crisis. Already facing its own internal political problems after nearly a year of mass protests that have led to changes in its leadership, Algiers is worried about new security threats arising from any escalation in Libya.
