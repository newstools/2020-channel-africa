In a statement, ZTA Head of Corporate Affairs Godfrey Koti said it has come to their attention with “great concern” that some players in the tourism industry were breaching the laid down guidelines and protocols to curb the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. Following the 21-day Covid-19 national lockdown that began on March 30, the Government promulgated Statutory Instrument 099 of 2020, allowing all formal businesses to resume operations under level 2 of the lockdown. A further relaxation of the lockdown regulations was granted through SI 160 of 2020 allowing sit-in guests in restaurants. It has, however, came to the attention of ZTA with great concern that some operators are not following the guidelines and protocols as well as the conditions set out in the above Statutory Instruments. “Operators are advised that ZTA regulatory and quality assurance team in conjunction with the relevant arms of government will be rigorously monitoring and enforcing compliance. “Any breach will leave the authorities with no option other than to close those operations found in breach,” said Koti. The monitoring and enforcement of compliance will be on-going throughout the lockdown period across the country. The authority commended Government and the Tourism Business Council of Zimbabwe for their efforts in reopening the tourism industry.  --Herald--
