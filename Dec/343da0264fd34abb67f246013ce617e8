The US move comes in the context of Christian groups talking about growing insecurity. US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, said the rare inclusion of a fellow democracy is part of an effort to shame Nigeria into action. It is the second time in a row that Nigeria has been included in the US list. But in a statement Information Minister, Lai Mohammed, said the allegation is a case of an honest disagreement between the two nations on the causes of violence in Nigeria. He said that Nigeria jealously protects religious freedom as enshrined in the country's constitution and takes any infringements seriously. The minister explained that victims of insecurity and terrorism in the country are adherents of Christianity, Islam and other religions --BBC--
