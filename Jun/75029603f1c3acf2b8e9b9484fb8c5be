Banro will receive a perpetual royalty for all production from the Namoya property in eastern DRC, it said. The deal is subject to final approval from Congoâ€™s government. Banro told Reuters in February it was looking to sell Namoya at a significant discount, after repeated attacks by militia forced the company to suspend operations at several mine sites. --Reuters--
