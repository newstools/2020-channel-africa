Alaa Abdel-Fattah was one of the key figures in the uprising that drove Hosni Mubarak from power in 2011. He has since served a five year jail sentence and is currently back in detention after being re-arrested in September as the authorities mounted a new campaign in response to small-scale government protests. A well-known Islamist politician, Adel-Monaem Abul Fetouh, is also among those put on a terrorism list for the next five years.
