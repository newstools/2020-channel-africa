A private firm in Egypt, Dolphinus Holdings, will purchase 85 billion cubic meters (bcm) of gas, worth an estimated $19.5 billion, from Israel’s Leviathan and Tamar offshore fields over 15 years. Israeli Energy Minister, Yuval Steinitz said the deal was “just the start” of co-operation with Egypt. Yossi Abu, Chief Executive Officer of Israel’s Delek Drilling, one of the partners in Leviathan and Tamar, said the arrangement “marks a new era in the Middle East energy sector”. Israel will initially export 200 million cubic feet of gas per day to Egypt, two Egyptian industry sources said. Gas from Leviathon will be supplied to Dolphinus at a rate of 2.1 bcm per year, rising to 4.7 bcm per year by the second half of 2022, according to Delek. The gas is being supplied via a subsea pipeline connecting Israel and Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula, which Steinitz said had sufficient capacity for current volumes, though the option of building a second pipeline was being considered if demand from Egypt grew. Exports of Tamar gas to Dolphinus are expected to start later this year. Israeli officials have called the export of gas to Egypt the most significant deal to emerge since the countries signed a historic peace treaty in 1979. “The fact that the three countries, Israel, Egypt and Jordan are now collaborating together and are already connected with a regional gas transmission system, this is significant and it will contribute to peace and security in the Middle East,” Steinitz told Reuters in an interview in Cairo. Jordan received its first supplies of Israeli gas at the start of the month. --Reuters--
