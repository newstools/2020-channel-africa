Trump, who leaves office on Jan. 20 after losing November’s election to President-elect Joe Biden, backed down from his earlier threat to block the bill, which was approved by Congress last week, after he came under intense pressure from lawmakers on both sides. The Republican president, who golfed on Sunday and remained out of public view even as the government crisis loomed, had demanded that Congress change the bill to increase the size of stimulus checks for struggling Americans to $2000 from $600 and also cut some other spending. It was not immediately clear why Trump, who has refused to concede defeat to Biden, changed his mind on the stimulus package. 

His resistance had threatened to inject further chaos into the final stretch of his presidency. After signing the bill behind closed doors at his beachside club, Trump sought to put the best face on his climb-down, saying he was signing the bill with “a strong message that makes clear to Congress that wasteful items need to be removed.” “Much more money is coming,” he insisted in a statement, though he provided nothing to back this promise. And with less than a month left in office, Trump is expected to gain little or no traction with lawmakers to make changes. White House officials have been tight-lipped about Trump’s thinking but a source familiar with the situation said some advisers had urged him to relent because they did not see the point of refusing. Democrats have long been on board with the $2000 payments but many Republicans have opposed it, making it unlikely that the figure will be revised upwards while Trump is in office.
