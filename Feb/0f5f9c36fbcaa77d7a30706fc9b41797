“They tell themselves: ‘It’s too scary, I don’t understand the system, I can’t afford it,” said 39-year-old Thiam, who started Kepaarel, a cafe and co-working space geared toward mothers in Senegal’s capital, Dakar. This may soon change. Senegal in December became the second African country after Tunisia to pass a so-called start-up act, a law providing tax breaks and other benefits to innovative new businesses in fields from agriculture to mobile banking. Senegal has a young population that is quitting its farms for the cities but not enough industry to employ them. The government hopes to spur more local business with its reforms, and is prioritising digital technology as one of the pillars of President Macky Sall’s “Emergent Senegal” plan. Though it lags far behind bigger economies in the region such as Ghana and Nigeria, Senegal is the leader among Francophone countries in Africa and sees itself as a future tech and entrepreneurship hub for the continent. The law, which is meant to come into effect later this year, applies to all start-ups but officials said they are targeting female and youth-run businesses in particular, as well as businesses that do good. “This law will unleash the talent of our young entrepreneurs to have a real social impact,” said Thierno Sakho, Project Manager at Senegal’s $50 million state fund for start-ups. “We want solutions that address... poverty, malnutrition and financial inclusion,” he told Reuters. Dozens of Senegalese start-ups have launched in recent years including a recycling scheme for electronic waste and a digital wallet for storing medical records, though many have struggled to grow. --Reuters--
