There was a significant contraction of the economy in the second quarter of 2020 and the country now faces possible recession. Tabling a “Budget of Economic Recovery and Resilience” in parliament, Buhari said the pandemic had wreaked havoc on the global economy, including Nigeria's. Nevertheless, he expected the country's economy - the largest in Africa - to expand by 3% next year. Nigeria is Africa’s top oil producer and depends heavily on crude sales for foreign exchange earnings, but low oil prices have seen the economy struggling. This week, Nigerian lawmakers approved plans by Buhari to borrow $11billion to fund the 2021 expenditure. This is expected to push Nigeria’s total debt to $90 billion. Buhari's spending plans would be implemented only if they are approved by lawmakers. --BBC--
