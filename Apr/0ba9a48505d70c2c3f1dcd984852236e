Another group of 50 children is expected to fly from Athens to Germany on Saturday, and 20 more will head to Switzerland at a later date. Greece hopes to relocate some 1600 unaccompanied minors in the coming months. The children relocated on Wednesday were aged between 11 and 15. Ten were from Afghanistan and two from Syria. At least 5200 migrant children from Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq and African countries currently live in Greece, many of them under harsh conditions in camps on islands in the Aegean. Deputy migration Minister Giorgos Koumoutsakos said that although the number of children was small, it sent a strong message for others to follow the example set by Luxembourg. Greece, he said, is having to bear a disproportionate share of the refugee burden. “Greece faces a crisis within a crisis; migration and the pandemic together,” he told state broadcaster ERT. “The combination makes an already difficult situation even more so, and more complex.” Having imposed a lockdown early on, Greece has weathered the coronavirus pandemic relatively well compared to many other European countries, with 2170 confirmed cases and 101 deaths to date. --BBC—
