The two sides, Â the Government of National Accord based in Tripoli and the eastern parliament led by Gen Khalifa Haftar, signed a ceasefire last month, and will today start negotiations on forming a single government with the aim of holding elections. The head of the United Nations (UN) mission, Stephanie Williams, said there had already been significant progress and these latest talks offered Libyans a unique opportunity. Seventy-five people will take part in the talks, selected by the UN to represent Libya's political, military and social factions. --BBC--
