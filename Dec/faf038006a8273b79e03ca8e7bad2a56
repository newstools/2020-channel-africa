Thirty-five MPs voted in favour of the motion, three rejected it while one lawmaker abstained from voting. The eight are Abdijamal Osman, Abdiqani surato, Muse Jajabsay, Gen. Baduugaaye, Mohamud Mohamed Barre, Saleeban Farah, Abdirahman Dhore and Mohamud Ahmed Aalim, according to Radio Dalsan. Puntland's Attorney General Mohamud Hassan Aw-Osman on Thursday said the legislators may now face legal action. They were accused of breaking the regional laws. --BBC--
