Britain left the EU in January but has full access to the bloc under a transition period that runs until the end of December 2020. London and Brussels blamed each other last week for missing a June 30 deadline for assessments on financial market access from January. Future direct EU access will depend on whether Brussels deems United Kingdom (UK) regulation to be “equivalent” to standards in the bloc. Although it is far more limited than current access, without equivalence EU investors would not be able to use financial services in London. “Covid-19 has the potential to disrupt Brexit planning including impacting client readiness, as well as potentially affecting the ability of firms to relocate staff to other jurisdictions,” AFME said in a statement. AFME said ensuring that EU investors can continue using clearing houses in London needed addressing before the end of September to avoid customers having to move derivatives positions elsewhere. --Reuters--
