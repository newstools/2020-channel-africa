The analysis finds considerable gaps in trade integrity in all three areas of analysis and potential revenue losses of $5.7 billion in global trade, $279.4 million in trade in crude oil and $575.2 million in trade in gold during the seven years covered in the report. Trade integrity is defined as international trade transactions that are legal, properly priced and transparent. Developing countries lose billions of dollars a year in tax due to trade misinvoicing, corruption and criminal activity associated with a lack of trade integrity, which hampers abilities to mobilise funds to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic and achieve the United Nations (UN) 2030 Agenda. The report includes regulatory analyses for the trade, crude oil and gold sectors, along with surveys conducted with leading Sudanese thought leaders in academia, government and civil society. Tom Cardamone, President & Chief Executive Officer of GFI, issued the following statement: “Given the tremendous hardships the people of Sudan have suffered over the years there is still significant optimism about the country’s future. The surveys are revealing in that Sudan’s problems are well understood and the remedies are obtainable. It is hoped that the scale of the losses revealed in this report will be a catalyst for national and international action.” Notable findings for global trade (all figures in USD): Notable findings for crude oil (all figures in USD): Notable findings for gold (all figures in USD): GFI provided bespoke policy recommendations for the Government of Sudan to improve the trade integrity of the global trade, crude oil and gold sectors. --Global Financial Integrity--
