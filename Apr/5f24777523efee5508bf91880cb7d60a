"Two Boko Haram bombers blew themselves up at around 8pm" in the attack on Amchide, on the border with Nigeria, a policeman said on Monday, while a local official said a village chief and two teenagers were among the dead. Amchide is a small trading village in Cameroon's Far North province, a tongue of land that lies between Chad to the east and Nigeria to the west. The province has been hit since 2014 by Boko Haram fighters making incursions from northeast Nigeria. --News24--
