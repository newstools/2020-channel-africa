The scandal, which could open the can of worms on the scourge that has devoured continental football over the years, has seen players from four countries failing the MRI scans and ended up being thrown out of the tournament currently underway in South Africa. Zimbabwe, Botswana, Eswatini and Comoros Islands were on Friday booted out of the regional tournament in the Eastern Cape after at least one of their players failed the MRI scans done in South Africa. The tournament, currently underway at the Nelson Mandela Bay, is also used as the zonal qualifiers for the Africa Cup of Nations. The organisers have been forced to restart the competition with only four teams. Unlike Zimbabwe, who are disputing the results of the MRI scans conducted in South Africa, Botswana responded promptly to the allegations by suspending their chief executive and immediately launched full scale investigations to establish how their team ended up with over-aged players in their ranks. Unfortunately for the Young Zebras, no MRI tests were conducted before they left for the tournament. “The BFA was asked by CAF to do four tests which include X-ray, ECG, MRI and COVID-19 tests. We managed to do only three tests excluding MRI. “According to our protocols in terms of team selection, we target players of 14 to 15 years so that they are in our structures of the team for at least 2-year circle. --Herald--
