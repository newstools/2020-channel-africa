Osmar Legal did not clarify what the crimes were but told Brazilian news site Globoesporte “there are indications that other crimes were committed” by Ronaldinho and his brother and business manager, Roberto Assis. Ronaldinho’s lawyer did not immediately respond to Reuters’ requests for comment. Ronaldinho, the ex-Barcelona, Paris St Germain, AC Milan and Gremio forward, and Roberto were remanded in custody on Saturday after being caught trying to enter Paraguay using doctored passports. A judge ruled them a flight risk and said they must remain in jail while the investigation takes place. Under Paraguayan law, officials have six months to complete their enquiry. The pair spent Friday and Saturday night in a jail cell in a maximum security facility. They were given soap, pillows and mosquito repellent and were led into court on Saturday in handcuffs. Sunday was visiting day at the prison and Globoesporte said the brothers remained inside their cell to avoid the attention of families and children visiting the other inmates.
