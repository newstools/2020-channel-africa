Hamilton's deal runs out at the end of 2020 and talks are at an early stage. Wolff said: "We are not worried about eventually getting it done. We are not putting a special date to it because we don't want to be under pressure. "Sooner or later it needs to be done and at the latest before we go testing (ahead of the 2021 season)." Pre-season testing next year runs over just three days at Spain's Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya on March 2-4. Wolff said that he and Hamilton had always intended not to start contract negotiations until this year's championship titles were won. But he said Hamilton contracting coronavirus before the penultimate race of the season had "delayed us a little bit". Wolff added: "We had such a successful run of championships in the past seven years there is no reason not to continue. He is on the top of his game and will be for a while, and that's why continuing together is a no-brainer."
