The overnight attack by suspected vigilantes from the Dogon community was in Ogossagou - the same village where 160 people were killed in June last year. That attack led to the resignation of the entire Malian government. An official in the village, which is predominantly Fulani, said some of the victims had been burnt and there are reports that around 20 people are still missing. Correspondents say Fulani communities have frequently come under attack because of the perception that Islamist militants have recruited from their villages.
