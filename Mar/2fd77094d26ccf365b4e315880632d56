In a statement, Tunisiaâ€™s ministry of interior said the suicide bombers were targeting a security patrol in the area. Five policemen sustained various types of injuries and one civilian was lightly wounded, according to officials. A similar attack was carried out in central Tunis in June last year and the year before that, where security patrols also appeared to be the target. The US embassy in Tunis is a very tightly secured and sprawling compound in the financial district of Lac 2, where several other embassies are based.  --BBC--
