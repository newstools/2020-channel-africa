Economic activity in advanced economies is anticipated to contract 7% in 2020 as domestic demand and supply, trade, and finance have been severely disrupted, the report said. The United States economy is projected to shrink by 6.1% this year, while Euro Area could see a 9.1% contraction. Emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs), meanwhile, are expected to contract by 2.5% this year, “their first contraction as a group in at least sixty years,” according to the report. The economic activity in Latin America and the Caribbean, in particular, could plunge by 7.2% in 2020. Growth in East Asia and Pacific is projected to fall to 0.5% in 2020, the only region that could see growth this year, the report said. The Chinese economy is expected to grow by 1% this year. The outlook for global economy is “highly uncertain and downside risks are predominant,” including the possibility of a more protracted pandemic, financial upheaval, and retreat from global trade and supply linkages, the report noted. A downside scenario could lead the global economy to shrink by as much as 8% this year, followed by a sluggish recovery in 2021 of just over 1%, with output in EMDEs contracting by almost 5% this year. “The current episode has already seen by far the fastest and steepest downgrades in global growth forecasts on record,” said World Bank Prospects Group Director Ayhan Kose. In the previous Global Economic Prospects report released in January, the multilateral lender projected global economy to grow by 2.5% this year. --Herald--
