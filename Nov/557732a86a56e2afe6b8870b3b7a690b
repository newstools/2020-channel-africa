The four, the Centre for Food and Adequate Living Rights Ltd and the Africa Institute for Energy Governance both based in Kampala, the Nairobi-based Natural Justice-Kenya and the Centre for Strategic Litigation Ltd based in Zanzibar, want the construction of the pipeline stopped until the matter is heard and determined. The four NGOs claim that the EACOP project, announced a month ago by Uganda’s President’s Yoweri Museveni and his Tanzania’s counterpart John Magufuli is yet to conduct an environmental and social impact assessment as required by both the EAC Treaty and other international laws. They claim it contravenes the EAC Treaty and protocols that determine the undertaking of such a project. The NGOs are now seeking a permanent injunction against Uganda, Tanzania and the EAC, whom they have sued, from constructing the pipeline through protected areas, among other orders. The pipeline will transport crude oil from Hoima district in Uganda to Chongoleani in Tanga, Tanzania. --TheEastAfrican--
