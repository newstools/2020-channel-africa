Dominici was best known for helping France knock New Zealand out of the 1999 Rugby World Cup. A witness saw him climb the roof of a disused building at Saint-Cloud park, near Paris, on Tuesday before falling, officials say. Prosecutors have opened an inquiry into the cause of his death. "So much sadness. Christophe Dominici was an immense player, an artist. His sudden death is a shock," said sports minister Roxana Maracineanu. Dominici played 67 times for his country and won the French championship five times with Stade Français before retiring in 2008. In recent years he had worked as a pundit for French radio and Television. His 1999 World Cup semi-final performance spurred France to a sensational comeback, as he darted down the left of the pitch and seized the ball ahead of two New Zealand defenders to score a try. 

The All Blacks were leading the game at the time and had the brilliant Jonah Lomu in their line-up.
