Governments across Europe have taken draconian measures to slow the pandemic, shutting borders, closing schools, shops, restaurants and ordering citizens to stay at home. Spain's 47 million people have been under partial lockdown since Saturday night, allowed to leave their homes only to go to work, buy food or visit a pharmacy or hospital. More than 1 000 troops have been deployed across the country, telling people without a good reason to be outside to go home, while army specialists spray disinfectant in train stations.
