Woods has never won in 12 prior starts at Riviera, the classic course in Pacific Palisades west of Los Angeles where he made his first tour start as a 16-year-old back in 1992. Woods made a perfect start to his second bid to break his and Sam Snead's shared record of 82 PGA Tour titles, eagling the par-five first hole and adding birdies at the fifth and eighth. But the back nine was a battle all the way, starting with a tee shot into the left rough at the 10. His tee shot at 11 hit a tree, and while he managed to give himself a look at birdie on the par-five hole his 10-foot putt didn't drop. After a bogey at the 12 - where his approach rolled through the green, Woods came up with par saves at 13, 15 and 17, where he was in a fairway bunker off the tee but salvaged par by two-putting from 68 feet. In the right rough off the tee at 18, Woods ended with a bogey that left him five shots behind leader Matt Kuchar. "I got off to a nice start on the front nine and just didn't hit many good shots on the back nine," the 15-time major champion said after hitting just one of seven fairways on the back nine.
