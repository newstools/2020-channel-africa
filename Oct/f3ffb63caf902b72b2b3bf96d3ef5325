Among the measures lined out by finance minister Tito Mboweni at the ‘mini budget’ on Wednesday, South Africa aims to rein in the fiscal deficit via the public sector compensation channel. It was emphasised that the largest share of spending reductions will fall on public sector compensation, but as was expected, there was little new news on this front. The courts look set to decide what happens to compensation this year, while the figures for coming years are not yet finalised. At the close of local trade, the rand quoted 1.19% weaker at R16.38/$, after trading in range of R16.17/$ - R16.49/$. The rand traded flat overnight. Expected range today R16.20/$ - R16.50/$.
