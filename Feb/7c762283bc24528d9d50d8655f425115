Unai Garcia's diving header put Osasuna ahead after 14 minutes, but two goals in five minutes from Isco and Sergio Ramos gave Real a half-time advantage. Lucas Vazquez, who replaced Gareth Bale after the Welshman's first start for five games, and fellow substitute Luka Jovic sealed victory late on. Champions Barcelona beat Real Betis 3-2 later on Sunday to remain in touch. Osasuna made their positive start count as Garcia headed in from Ruben Garcia's corner, but their good work was undone before half-time as Isco volleyed in from close range and Ramos headed in when unmarked at the back post from a corner. The result remained in the balance until Vazquez powerfully converted from Karim Benzema's pass, while 22-year-old Jovic emerged from the bench after 87 minutes to add a fourth. Bale, 30, was withdrawn after 70 minutes in his first appearance since suffering an ankle sprain against Unionistas de Salamanca on 22 January, despite being fit for the past three fixtures. --BBC--
