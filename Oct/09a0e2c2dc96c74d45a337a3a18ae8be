World number 248 Otaegui, 27, carded a stunning final-round 63 on the resort's Torrance course to win by four stokes. Overnight leader Wallace was second after a 71, with compatriots Aaron Rai (66), Chris Paisley (68) and Garrick Porteous (71) making up the top five. After three 66s to start, Wallace had three bogeys on a haphazard final day. But Otaegui, who had set the pace on the first day with a peerless 62, carded 10 birdies on the outskirts of St Andrews to romp to his third European Tour victory. Ewen Ferguson was the leading home player, finishing in a tie for 11th after a closing 67. --BBC--
