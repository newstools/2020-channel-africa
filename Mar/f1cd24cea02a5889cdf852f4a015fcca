Leicester’s goal-machine Vardy had not found the net since December 21 but converted a penalty just past the hour to double Leicester’s lead shortly after replacing Kelechi Iheanacho. Harvey Barnes had opened the scoring before halftime after a dreadful misjudgement by Villa keeper, Pepe Reina. Vardy struck again after 79 minutes to take his league tally to 19 goals for the season before Barnes claimed his second to make it a miserable night for Leicester’s Midlands rivals Villa who beat them in the League Cup semi-final. It was the Foxes first win in five league games, ending a slump that had put their top-four place and hopes of qualifying for Champions League football next season in peril. Third-placed Leicester began the night only five points above fifth-placed Manchester United but the victory means they have re-established a healthy gap. Leicester have 53 points from 29 games, Chelsea have 48 and United 45. All have nine games remaining. After being caught by Arsenal’s Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Vardy is again the league’s top scorer by two goals. --Reuters--
