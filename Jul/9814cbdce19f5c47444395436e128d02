The ceremony coincides with Malawi's 56th independence day. On Sunday, President Chakwera ordered that the ceremony be moved from the national stadium to the country's military headquarters as concern grows over coronavirus infection rates. Malawi has so far recorded a total of 1,742 Covid-19 cases, including 19 deaths. Not many international delegates attended the ceremony, with Tanzanian Vice-President Samia Suluhu the most high profile dignitary in attendance. Former President Peter Mutharika, who lost to Chakwera in last month's rerun election, did not attend to officially hand over to his successor. --BBC-- #ChakweraInauguration in pictures#NationOnline pic.twitter.com/tJuYNYz1Gw
