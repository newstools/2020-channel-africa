The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) which is chaired by the South African Reserve Bank Governor, Lesetja Kganyago, is due to meet from March 17 to19 to announce its rate review decision on the last day. The meeting also comes few days ahead of Moody’s review of SA’s credit rating on March 27. The MPC surprised some analysts in January when it cut South Africa’s repo rate to 6.25%, its lowest point since December 2015. In his statement then, Kganyago said the committee expected Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for the fourth quarter of 2019 to show "some positive growth". But that was not the case as the country slipped into a technical recession when the economy shrank by 1.4% in the fourth quarter of 2019. GDP had contracted by 0.8% in the third quarter and for 2019, it grew by only 0.2% in real terms. South Africa’s growth prospects have been worsened by the impact of the coronavirus on different industries and implications of the oil price crash which caused bloodbath in the local stocks and the rand to plummet to the lowest level seen in 2016.
