After more than four months away from the game, South Africa's top-flight teams will get back onto the field shortly, with the Nedbank Cup semifinals on August 8 and the league resuming on August 11. Komphela believes injuries could be a real problem for many teams as players are not used to being away from the game for such a long period. Arrows are seventh in the PSL standings and will resume their league campaign on August 15 when they take on Stellenbosch. "We are looking forward to the challenge in the last seven remaining matches. We know the games will be coming thick and fast," Komphela told Daily Sun. "We just have to cope and hope we won't have too many injuries. But I anticipated a lot of teams, naturally so, will be struggling with a number of injuries. We just hope they are not too bad so we can see the season over. The study and data collected have shown that there were lots of injuries and they're still happening," he continued. "I'm sure South Africa is not going to be different. We just hope they don't become a hindrance. It is just seven matches left. We didn't have many injury concerns before the suspension kicked in. We had come from a solid pre-season, had played matches and the loading of the players was sufficiently scientific. Now there has been an issue about the restart. We have been doing training sessions via zoom and we only just got back to the training field." --News24--
