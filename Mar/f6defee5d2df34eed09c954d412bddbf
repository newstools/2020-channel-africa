Major General Shafie Abdel Halim Dawoud “died while fighting the coronavirus”, state television said, without giving any details. State media announced on Sunday that Major General Khaled Shaltout had died for the same reason. Egypt has so far registered 327 cases of the respiratory disease caused by the virus, including 14 fatalities, the health ministry said on Sunday.
