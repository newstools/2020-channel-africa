The power cuts by ailing State power utility, Eskom, are one of the biggest challenges facing President Cyril Ramaphosa as he tries to revive investor confidence. 

The research shows that 1 498 Gigawatt hours (GWh) of energy had been shed so far in the first eight months of 2020, more than the 1 352 GWh in the whole of 2019. The CSIR estimates that load shedding last year cost the economy up to $8 billion. 

The CSIR predicts load shedding will continue for two to three years, due to Eskom’s unreliable ageing infrastructure and enormous debt burden. Minerals and Energy Minister Gwede Mantashe said various interventions have been put in place to relieve Eskom of energy supply pressure. Mantashe said the department has allowed municipalities to purchase their own electricity from their sources and encouraged self-generation to take the pressure out of the power grid. 

“One of those is self-generation for own use. We are driving that energetically so that we take away pressure from the grid. Two, we have allowed municipalities to purchase their own electricity from sources of their own choice. Thirdly, you would have noticed that over the last weekend, we issued the request for proposals for the emergency purchases of electricity.” --SABC--
