According to a special report by rating agency, Fitch, on eight banks that control 83% of the industry’s deposits and 76% of the total assets, weaker operating conditions have resulted in substantially lower earnings and profitability metrics for the lenders that have also borne the brunt of huge loan restructuring to protect borrowers whose loan repayments have been impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic. The situation has been compounded by the severe locust infestation since July 2019 which could create further pressure on the banks’ asset quality through lending to the small-scale farmers and farming communities. Debt relief measures granted to distressed borrowers to mitigate the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and the subdued loan growths are also expected to dampen profitability. Fitch, through its report titled 'Coronavirus Impact on Large Kenyan Banks’ shows that the annualised average net income to average equity ratio of these large banks declined by 730 basis points (bp) to 11.6% in the first six months of this year. The report dated October 8 shows that the lenders KCB, Equity, NCBA, Co-operative Bank, Diamond Trust Bank (DTB), Absa Bank (Kenya) Standard Chartered Bank (Kenya) and Stanbic Bank (Kenya) started the year 2020 on a weaker footing characterised by deteriorating asset quality, with an average impaired loan ratio of 11.2% last year compared with 9.9% in 2018. --TheEastAfrican--
