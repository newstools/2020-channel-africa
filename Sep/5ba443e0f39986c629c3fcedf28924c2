Agricultural exports recorded in June 2020 $231.7 million down from $244.6 million in June 2019 with a decline of $12.8 million. The top exported crops in June 2020 are potato ($11.2 million), onion ($10.2 million), and vegetables ($6.4 million). The trade balance deficit hit in June 2020 $3.3 billion rising by 8.6 % compared to $3.6 billion in June 2019. That is because the value of exports decreased by 7.9 % to become $2.3 billion in June 2020 against $2.5 billion in June 2019. That is attributed to the decline of the value of certain goods such as fresh fruits (10.5%), garments (2.5%), crude oil (46.3%), and micro plastics (10.4%). The Cabinet plans to boost agricultural exports in FY2020/2021 by entering new markets through grapes, citrus, and garlic.  The targeted markets are Southeast Asia, Canada, and a number of African and Latin American countries. The government wants to increase agricultural exports in the current fiscal year to 6.75 million tons from 5.58 million tons in FY2018/2019. That is why the Cabinet plans to encourage the cultivation of horticulture crops, particularly those of which Egypt has achieved self-sufficiency. The percentage for zucchini, bell pepper and green beans is 105 %, while that for citrus is 140 %. The government wants to enlarge the area cultivated with olives by 40 000 feddans as it is now 54 000 feddans and continue growing 100 million olive trees. That is in addition to expanding greenhouse farming like the 100 000 Greenhouse Project established by the Egyptian Armed Forces, and organic agriculture. --EgyptToday--
