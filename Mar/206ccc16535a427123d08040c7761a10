Somalia's President, Mohamed Abdullahi "Farmajo" Mohamed, and his Kenyan counterpart Uhuru Kenyatta spoke on Thursday morning, a day after Kenya accused Somalia's military of carrying out an attack across its border.

The two leaders agreed to work together to improve border security, and form two committees drawn from both countries to look into strengthening diplomatic and trade relations, according to Somalia's presidential team. Somali soldiers on Monday destroyed buildings in the northern Kenyan town of Mandera while fighting forces from Somalia's semi-autonomous state of Jubbaland. Kenyatta in a statement had accused Somalia of breaching Kenya's territorial integrity. Tension has been escalating between the two countries which are involved in a maritime border dispute. The border dispute case is set to be heard at the International Court of Justice in June.
