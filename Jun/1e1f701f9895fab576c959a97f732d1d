The fast-tracked ceremony follows the death of the incumbent, Pierre Nkurunziza, last week. In a letter, the Foreign Ministry invited diplomats and foreign organisations to attend the inauguration in the capital, Gitega. Ndayishimiye is a former Hutu rebel and army general, like his predecessor. He received the backing of Nkurunziza before winning the presidential election in May. He had been due to be sworn in August, but the Constitutional Court brought forward the ceremony following the death of the President. --BBC--
