New York became the latest state to introduce stricter social distancing rules on Wednesday, as new infections in the country surged above 100 000 for an eighth consecutive day. The blue-chip Dow was pulled down by industrial and financial companies sensitive to economic growth, with Boeing Co and Goldman Sachs down 3% and 1.6%, respectively. Airlines and cruise operators, among the hardest hit by the coronavirus pandemic, also fell. The S&P 1500 airlines index dropped 3.1%, while Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd fell 4% and Carnival Corp  tumbled almost 8%. “The market is reacting to the rise in COVID cases nationwide,” said Michael Antonelli, a market strategist at Baird in Milwaukee. “Vaccine news helps at some point in the future, but today we are dealing with an accelerating spread,” Even after Thursday’s drop, the S&P 500 has gained almost 2% this week, buoyed by positive vaccine trial data that increased expectations of a quick economic recovery. Stocks have also benefited from expectations that a divided Congress will keep President-elect Joe Biden from enacting tax hikes that would hurt corporate profits. “The reality is that we don’t know what the new normal is going to look like, even when we do recover from the coronavirus, and that is still a ways away,” said Tom Martin, senior portfolio manager at Globalt Investments in Atlanta. “It’s the classic between the market discounting something that is nine to 12 months out, and then ‘undercounting’ it because it has not happened yet.” --Reuters--
