Woods said it's on the table whether they bifurcate or not, noting that differing equipment rules could keep the game more enjoyable for the less-skilled while still limiting the distance professionals could hit the ball in competition. "We want to keep the game enjoyable, we want to keep having more kids want to come play it," he said of the argument for allowing more forgiving clubs and balls designed to maximise distance for recreational use. Critics of the bifurcation solution argue that amateur golfers like knowing they use the same equipment as the pros. Different equipment standards could make transitioning from the amateur to professional ranks more difficult. But with advances in fitness and equipment, professionals are hitting the ball further and further. Woods, who has watched - and helped inspire - the evolution over the course of his career believes it can't continue. "We've come a long way and what's been crazy is that I've been a part of all that," he said. "When I first started on tour I beat Davis Love in a playoff (in 1996) and he was using a persimmon driver. If you could carry it 270 (yards) you took a lot of trouble out of play.
