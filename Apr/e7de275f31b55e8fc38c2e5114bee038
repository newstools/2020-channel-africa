Reserve Bank Governor, Lesetja Kganyago, said the decision by the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC)to lower the repo rate was unanimous. The cut will go into effect on April 15. Tuesday's announcement was the second major cut in less than a month, after the central bank cut the rate by one percentage point in mid-March. "The May 2020 meeting of the MPC was moved earlier and took place today [Tuesday]," the bank said in a tweet, where it also announced the rate cut. The repo rate is the benchmark interest rate at which the Reserve Bank lends money to other banks. The unexpected cut caused the rand, which had been firming during the morning, to weaken from R18.02/$ to around R18.17/$. --NEWS24--
