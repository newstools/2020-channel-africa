were closed in March as a measure to curb the spread of Covid-19. Two weeks ago, President Salva Kiir ordered the resumption of schools and universities as the country continues to experience a significant reduction in coronavirus infections. The re-opening of schools was backed by a “Back to Learning Campaign” under the theme: “Safe learning during and after the Covid-19 pandemic.” Addressing students and teachers on Monday, Education Minister Awut Deng Achuil said the resumption of learning is to be carried out in two phases. First will be the primary school pupils and the oldest secondary school students due to sit final exams. Phase two will see the re-opening of all schools in April 2021. --BBC--
