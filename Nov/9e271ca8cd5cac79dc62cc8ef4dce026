Ziyech struck with his magic left foot seven minutes before halftime, his freekick from the right curling into the far post. Nayef Aguard’s attempt to give it a touch took the keeper off his balance and the ball easily swerved into the net. It was Morocco’s first effort on target with CAR having had the other chances at goal in the opening half. In the 10th minute, Foxi Kethevoama had a chance for the hosts, with his shot from a freekick flying straight into the keeper’s arms. They had another golden opportunity when Kethevoama broke into the box, but took too many touches, the keeper palming the ball off his feet while Donald Benamma’s attempt at the loose ball was blocked. In the second half, the home side stepped up in attack as they sought to get back on level terms and push for a winner. On the hour mark, Louis Mafouta had a chance with a freekick but he lifted his effort over. Five minutes later, Manasse Enza-Yamissi advanced from his left back position to win the ball in a favourable position, but his low shot flew inches across the face of goal. They had another opportunity when Ngam Ngam Saint Cyr took on a shot from distance, but the effort flew just wide off target. On the other end, CAR dodged a bullet when Youssef En Nesyri well taken low shot was blocked by the keeper. But there was no stopping the forward at the stroke of fulltime when he scored the easiest of goals, tapping in from a Ziyech cross to seal the win. --CAF--
