The contract rose 0.5% on Thursday and is now 2.2% higher for the week. “Oil prices appear to have stabilized this week on optimism that OPEC+ will once again do whatever it takes to tighten output and on hope that the coronavirus peak is nearing,” said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA in New York. Crude prices have plunged about 20% from their 2020 peaks on January 8 as oversupply concerns combined with worries about large fuel demand declines in China as the country’s quarantine to fight the coronavirus outbreak has stymied economic activity.
 
In response to the demand slump, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allied producers, known as OPEC+, are considering cutting output by up to 2.3 million barrels per day. “Sentiment remains cautious across Asia-Pacific region, due to virus uncertainty,” said Margaret Yang, market analyst at CMC Markets, adding that the extent of the virus-led global oil demand destruction remained unclear. But other analysts caution the demand impact is only limited to China so far.
