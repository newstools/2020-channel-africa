Video footage showed Italian health workers in masks and white protective suits taking the migrants' temperatures as they disembarked. The Spanish charity that runs the vessel, Open Arms, said the migrants, including children, were taken aboard during five separate operations in international waters. They'd set out from Libya in overcrowded boats. The rescue ship spent several days stranded at sea after Malta denied it permission to dock. Italy has previously allowed such ships to disembark rescued migrants at its ports on condition that other European Union nations agree to take some of them. --BBC--
