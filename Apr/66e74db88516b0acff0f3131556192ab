The company also cut its core earnings expectations from the Lake Charles Chemicals Project (LCCP) following a drop in oil and chemicals prices and lower global demand due to the spread of the coronavirus. It expects a loss in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) from LCCP of $50-$100 million for the financial year versus previous guidance of a profit there of up to $100 million. Investors have been concerned by the company’s debt, largely due to delays and cost overruns at the Louisiana-based LCCP. The world’s top manufacturer of motor fuel from coal, implemented measures in March to improve its liquidity in a low oil price environment including finding a partner for LCCP, asset sales and a potential $2 billion rights issue. --reuters--
