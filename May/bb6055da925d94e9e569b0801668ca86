The ruling by Germany's highest court for civil disputes, which will allow owners to return vehicles for a partial refund of the purchase price, serves as a template for about 60Â 000 lawsuits that are still pending with lower German courts. VW admitted in September 2015 to cheating emissions tests on diesel engines, a scandal which has already cost it more than $33 billion in regulatory fines and vehicle refits, mostly in the United States. US authorities banned the affected cars after the cheat software was discovered, triggering claims for compensation. But in Europe vehicles remained on the roads, leading Volkswagen to argue compensation claims there were without merit. European authorities instead forced the company to update its engine control software and fined it for fraud and administrative lapses. VW said on Monday it would work urgently with motorists on an agreement that would see them hold on to the vehicles for a one-off compensation payment. It did not give an estimate of how much the ruling by the German federal court, the Bundesgerichtshof (BGH), might cost it. VW shares were 0.5% lower at 1040 GMT. The BGH's presiding judge had signalled earlier this month he saw grounds for compensation.  --Reuters--
