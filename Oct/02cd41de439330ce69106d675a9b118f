A second round of voting is scheduled for November 7-8 for 13 other provinces. Run-offs for all the provinces will be held on different dates in November and December. The new legislators will begin their term in January 2021. More than 4,000 candidates are vying in the polls. The previous parliament was full of President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi's supporters. In 2013, Sisi led the military's overthrow of Egypt's first democratically elected President, Mohammed Morsi, following protests against his rule. --BBC-
