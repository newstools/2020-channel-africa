In January the government said “high-risk vendors” such as Huawei would be allowed into the non-sensitive parts of the 5G network, although their involvement will be capped at 35%. Asked about a letter to Conservative lawmakers by several former ministers expressing concern over Huawei, Liu Xiaoming told the BBC: “They are totally wrong, I think what they are doing is a kind of a witch-hunt. Huawei is a private-owned company, nothing to do with the Chinese government and the only problem they have is they are a Chinese company.” The Chinese government was pleased with Britain’s decision, he added, although not “100% satisfied” because the 35% cap “does not show your principle of a free economy, free competition”.
