The opening seven races of 2020 have already been postponed or cancelled, and now Baku is set to join them. As for the Red Bull-promoted Austrian GP, though, Marko told Osterreich: "Our marketing activities will start in mid-May.  We are keeping our plans." Red Bull mogul Dietrich Mateschitz has also told all staff members at the Red Bull Ring that they will be paid in full during the pandemic. Meanwhile, Marko said he supports the decision to scrap the 2021 regulations for now. He said: "That makes a lot of sense. All the teams are facing a loss of revenue. If five races are cancelled, that's 100 million lost. At least now we have stable regulations.  If we freeze that, the costs drop enormously and the regulation change will happen under the budget cap." Marko says the global coronavirus crisis took the world by surprise. He adds: "Nobody had such a scenario in mind with all the economic risks. I cannot imagine that the economy will last for long even with the aid packages. Corona has shown us how drastically vulnerable our economic system is to globalisation. "We also have to be careful that the mood of the population does not change." Until recently, he was playing down the situation, but Marko still thinks it is being badly mismanaged in parts.
