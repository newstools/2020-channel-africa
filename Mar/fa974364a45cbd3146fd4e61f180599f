The department on Sunday issued a statement in reaction to an earlier court application by the Business Rescue Practitioners to have the state-owned regional airline liquidated.

The State-owned airline's business rescue practitioners on March 25 lodged an application in Pretoria High Court for South African Express Â be placed in provisional liquidation.

The BRPs have indicated to the Department that $20 million will be required to save the airline. They had not received an answer at the time of the liquidation application.

The department, meanwhile, has said it will determine its course of action after studying the liquidation application.

SA Express was placed under business rescue in February due to financial pressures that resulted from years of poor management and state capture, the department said.

The application to place it into business rescue was brought by ZieglerSA, a service provider to the airline. --News24--
