The organisation also noted an increase in education and health related corruption cases. Health corruption accounted for 4% of reports of corruption received and 39% employment irregularities topped the list. Whistle-blowers reported that vacancies in the sector are designed to favour officials’ preferred candidates. Procurement irregularities accounted for 14% of cases relating to healthcare corruption by senior officials. The civil group released its annual report on corruption trends earlier today. Corruption Watch researcher, Melusi Ncala says, “At least in this set of data there has been an increase in corruption compared to last year. Much of that is during the lockdown period. I mean 55% of these reports of corruption were received during lockdown period.” “Of course … we are in a global crisis and health care is of paramount importance and what we seeing there are issues with procurement. There are a lot of irregularities where in some instances we have had a person heading a health facility insisting that his family members or friends should be the one awarded those tenders to be able to work in that hospital,” adds Ncala. Meanwhile, the Gauteng African National Congress Provincial Executive Committee (PEC) on Monday failed to release the personal protective equipment (PPE) tender report on the fate of those implicated in the controversy. --SABC--
