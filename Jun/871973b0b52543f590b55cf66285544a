Over in Europe, the German Bundesliga has already kicked off, the Premier League is due to get underway in a week's time, La Liga resumes this weekend, and the Serie A will return at the end of June. South Africans are still in the dark regarding the return of the PSL, but Jordaan believes Thursday's meeting with the Mthethwa will answer many questions. "The SA football delegation will be meeting with the minister for sports, arts and culture Nathi Mthethwa on Thursday," said Jordaan, as quoted by IOL. "I'm sure we'll have a clear picture of how and when soccer will resume, while at the same time it will clarify the government's position on the subject of reopening the Premiership. "Football also needs to (be) ready to implement the strict return-to-play protocols, and I'm confident that it will be in place. "Everyone involved with the organisation on hosting matches at stadiums must be au fait with guidelines and instructions of the government and health authorities." --NEWS24--
