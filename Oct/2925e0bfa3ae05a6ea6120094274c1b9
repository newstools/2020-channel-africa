Ncube revealed this while presenting the pre-budget strategy paper, themed â€œBuilding Resilience and Post Covid-19 Recovery in Harare last Friday ahead of the 2021 National Budget expected to be delivered sometime next month. VFEX, to be operated by Zimbabwe Stock Exchange, will allow listed companies to raise and trade their stock in any convertible hard currency, limiting the exchange risk. According to Ncube there is a need for the creation of globally recognised stock exchanges in Africa, those that arise from environments that are devoid of any negative impact of exchange rate fluctuations. He said the VFEX will be a Pan African bourse. The VFEX will be operated from the central business district of Victoria Falls, after being issued with a licence a few weeks ago, and will seek to partner any exchanges or international investment banks. --Herald--
