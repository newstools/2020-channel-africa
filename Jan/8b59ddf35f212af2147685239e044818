The 38-year-old American is aiming to match the record set in 1973 by Australia's Margaret Court, who will be recognised at the tournament on the 50th anniversary of her calendar Grand Slam. Old guard Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer are still expected to be the men to beat in Melbourne, while Britain's former world number one Andy Murray is missing because of a pelvic injury. The first Grand Slam of the 2020 season is set to go ahead as planned, despite the backdrop of raging bushfires that have devastated parts of Australia.
