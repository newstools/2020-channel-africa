The safety of the fans, teams and everyone involved comes first amid coronavirus fears and should have been called off much sooner after an F1 team member has tested positive for the COVID-19 virus. Earlier on Friday (March 13), Wheels24 reported that the Australian Grand Prix had been cancelled due to coronavirus fears. The FIA and F1 owners Liberty Media had waited until the final hour, just two hours before the first practice session was set to begin on Friday morning. AFP had reported the Australian Grand Prix Corporation said in a statement F1 advised of their intention not to hold the race, and therefore cancelled the race "immediately". The decision follows April's Chinese Grand Prix being postponed and with the second race of the year in Bahrain due to be held without spectators, leaving substantial question marks over the rest of the calendar, Wheels24 had reported earlier. The race was thrown into doubt on Thursday when McLaren pulled out after one of its team members tested positive for the virus. Before the race world champion, Lewis Hamilton had criticised the initial decision to hold the GP, telling reporters that he didn't "think it's great that we race". --AFP-- All I want to do is race. But safety and health comes first. Hope to be racing soon again!
