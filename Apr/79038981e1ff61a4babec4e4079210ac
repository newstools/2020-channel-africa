 The former Bafana Bafana winger, who has a football academy, the Delron Buckley Soccer School in Durban grabbed headlines when he said that a deal had been secured with Quinton Fortune and United's Class of '92 â€“ David Beckham, Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, Nicky Butt, Gary and Phil Neville to train local kids from South Africa. In an interview with KickOff, Buckley said: "So we've joined the Manchester United Class of '92, which is Ryan Giggs, Phil Neville and Nicky Butt for two years." "We've been given funding from another company to take kids from South Africa to Manchester United, obviously for trials, training, and the whole package basically." Fortune though was quick to respond, with his representative Sarah Collins telling ESPN: "There are no partnerships between QFA with any academies in South Africa currently. "We hope to one day fulfill the dream of Quinton Fortune to have a football academy in his home country, but work to do that has not yet been started and we are not in partnership with anyone to do so." Now, Di, the daughter of United legend Denis Law, says that nothing has yet reached her desk and that no deal has been confirmed. --News24--
