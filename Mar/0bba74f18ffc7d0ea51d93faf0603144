In the elite motorcycling championship, the 2020 season has yet to start. Teams, riders and organisers are trying to work out how they can rearrange the calendar, make up for financial losses and ensure a level track technically. While the Moto2 and Moto3 categories competed in the opening race in Qatar, the headline MotoGP event was cancelled. Dorna, the series promoter, has also postponed the next three events in Thailand, Texas and Argentina and hopes to run them in the second half of the season. The May races in Spain, France and Italy are in doubt. Dorna has already said it will push back the end of the season two weeks to November 29. It could  also add races during the summer break (July13-August 2) or extend the season further, within the limits imposed by logistics, time differences and weather. "Our aim," said  Dorna CEO Carmelo Ezpeleta, "is to maintain the Championship with the maximum number of races." As things stand, the revised season will end with two gruelling blocks of three races in three weeks, with just one week off in between "Physically we can manage everything," said Suzuki rider Joan Mir from Spain. "Mentally it will put us all to the test." Financially, MotoGP teams need to race, Herve Poncharal, the boss of the French Tech3 team, KTM's satellite in MotoGP and Moto3, told AFP.
