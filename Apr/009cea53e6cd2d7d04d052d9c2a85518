Fortune, who played for the Red Devils from 1999-2006, is currently a coach at the Premier League club's academy. Buckley, meanwhile, owns a football academy in Durban, which is set for a massive financial boost as a result of the new partnership. Speaking to KickOff, the former Bochum, Bielefeld and Borussia Dortmund striker said: "So we've joined the Manchester United Class of '92, which is Ryan Giggs, Phil Neville and Nicky Butt, and we've been sponsored with an amount of R5 million($280 000). "They've now given us funding to take kids from South Africa to Manchester United, obviously for trials, and the whole package basically. "It came about when I visited Quinton Fortune because he's a coach there. We put a little package together for the 'Class of '92' and I explained what I'm doing in South Africa. "Because our local kids don't get enough opportunities, and when I look at kids overseas and how they are doing and the sort of back-up they have, I realised our country needed the same and that's how we got to work with them. "We were supposed to send some players now but because of the coronavirus we couldn't do much. But as soon as it's over we are going to be able to send our first players over to Man United." Buckley added that he is also in talks with Dortmund over a similar deal.
