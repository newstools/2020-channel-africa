The demonstrations by the National Front for the Defence of the Constitution (FNDC), an alliance of opposition groups, has left at least three people dead. The opposition is suspending the protests from 15 January, the FNDC is quoted by AFP as saying. The suspension is to allow for the "calm burial of our victims and for Guineans to restock" basic goods. Previous demonstrations against Cond√© have been broken up by security forces leading to at least 20 deaths. --BBC--
