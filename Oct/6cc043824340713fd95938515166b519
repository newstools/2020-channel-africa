Airline executives have signaled a slow but steady improvement in leisure demand but do not foresee a recovery to 2019 levels for at least two years, with business and international travel particularly slow to bounce back amid ongoing travel restrictions. When the rebound finally arrives, airlines want to have a cost structure and network in place. “We’re ready to turn the page on seven months that have been dedicated to developing and implementing extraordinary and often painful measures, like furloughing 13 000 team members, to survive the worst financial crisis in aviation history,” said United CEO Scott Kirby. He acknowledged, however, that the “negative impact of COVID-19 will persist in the near term.” Shares closed down about 1% at $35.61 before the results were released and were down 1.37% in after-hours trading. Chicago-based United said its daily cash burn slowed to an average $25 million in the quarter ended September from $40 million in the second quarter, and included $4 million per day in severance and debt payments. Including voluntary departures, United said it has cut its workforce by 22,000 employees, leading to roughly $765 million in pretax costs in the third quarter. United had $19.4 billion of liquidity at September 30.
