This message has become louder in recent weeks, following the release of Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) proposals to turnaround the power utility, which is overburdened with mounting debt of over $28 billion. Among its proposals which address operational challenges and financial challenges, Cosatu has put forward that government establish a special purpose finance vehicle to reduce Eskom's debt to a more manageable $13 billion.

What this special purpose finance vehicle will look like has not yet been determined, but the proposal would require a social compact between labour, government and business bodies to decide how to reduce the debt. The public discourse on the proposal has been that government would likely use pension funds, through the Public Investment Corporation to finance the debt. Cosatu's Parliamentary Co-ordinator, Matthew Parks, however told Fin24 that its proposal might have been misrepresented in media as purely targeting pension funds.

Cosatu envisions a combination of public funding and private funding, Parks said.
