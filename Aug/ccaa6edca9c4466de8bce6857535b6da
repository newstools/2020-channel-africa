Hafeez tweeted a photograph of himself taken with a woman on the golf course near Pakistan's onsite hotel at the Ageas Bowl, where the second Test starts Thursday. But with the photograph clearly showing Hafeez and the unnamed individual were within the two-metre guideline for social distancing, the Pakistan Cricket Board announced later Wednesday the all-rounder would be isolated. "This morning, Mohammad Hafeez went to a golf course, which is adjacent to the team hotel and part of the bio-secure bubble," said a PCB statement. "During the golf round, he was photographed with a member of the public, which he subsequently posted on his social media account. "As it was evident from the photograph that Hafeez had breached the two-metre social distancing protocol and following a consultation process with the team doctor, the team management has decided to isolate him until he returns a negative Covid-19 test. "Hafeez underwent the Covid-19 test late Wednesday afternoon and the result is expected at some stage on Thursday." This series is being played under special protocols because of the global coronavirus outbreak, with the PCB statement adding the decision to isolate Hafeez had been taken "for his and the safety and security of everyone around him".
