The Federal Reserve lowered its benchmark rate by 50 basis points to a range of 1% to 1.25%. The emergency move comes after the G7 group of finance ministers pledged action earlier on Tuesday. It follows warnings that slowdown from the outbreak could tip countries into recession. Federal Reserve Chair, Jerome Powell, said the US economy remains strong but it is difficult to predict the "magnitude and persistence" of the effects of the spreading virus. "The virus and the measures that are being taken to contain it will surely weigh on economic activity for some time, both here and abroad," he said at a press conference in Washington. "We don't think we have all the answers. But we do believe that our action will provide a meaningful boost to the economy." The last time the bank made an interest rate cut at an emergency meeting was during the global financial crisis of 2008. The unanimous decision is a "dramatic turnaround from last week", when many Fed officials appeared confident that rates, already low by historical standards, would not need to be cut further, said Paul Ashworth, Chief US Economist at Capital Economics said. "With financial markets in turmoil and evidence growing that the coronavirus is developing into a pandemic, the Fed's change of heart is entirely understandable," he said. Powell said the bank believed the rate cut would help strengthen consumer and business confidence, and keep money flowing. Earlier on Tuesday, both Australia and Malaysia cut interest rates as a result of the outbreak, while finance ministers from the G7 group of nations pledged to use "all appropriate policy tools" to tackle the economic impact of coronavirus. The group of major economies said in a joint statement they were monitoring the outbreak and ready to deploy "fiscal measures". --BBC--
