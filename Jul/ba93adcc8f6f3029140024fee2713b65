It clarified that the launch comes as part of Uber’s continuous efforts to adapt its technology to build a wide range of products that meet the needs of local markets. “Following the Covid-19 lockdown period, Uber is excited to continue expanding its presence in Egypt with a safe and affordable ride,” it added. “We are honoured to witness another global product launch from Egypt, especially following the last few tense months across the country and the world. Egypt is an innovation hub and a fantastic environment for testing new products. By leveraging Uber’s technology, the new intercity service will introduce a convenient setting to move users between governorates”, said Ahmed Khalil, General Manager of Uber Egypt. “As we continue to invest in the Egyptian market, we remain committed to broaden our product range to provide convenient transportation solutions within and across cities,” he added. According to the statement, the bus intercity service will launch with roundtrip routes between Cairo and Alexandria, with plans to expand to connect other governorates over the coming months. The service operates seven days a week, with eight journeys per day. For the convenience of frequent travellers, riders can also pre-book their trips through the app. The route provides up to nine pick-up and drop off points across Cairo and Alexandria. Uber noted that intercity buses will follow Uber’s COVID-19 safety measures, where riders and drivers are required to wear face masks during trips, maximum seating capacity has been reduced to encourage physical distancing between riders, and sanitizer dispensers have been installed in all the buses. --EgyptToday--
