“Certain drugs intended for the Canadian market are prohibited from being distributed for consumption outside of Canada if that sale would cause or worsen a drug shortage,” Health Minister Patty Hajdu said in a statement. “Companies will now also be required to provide information to assess existing or potential shortages, when requested, and within 24 hours if there is a serious or imminent health risk,” the statement said. The Canadian measure went into effect on Friday, just days before a United States (US) “Importation Prescription Drugs” rule that would eventually allow licensed US pharmacists or wholesalers to import in bulk certain prescription drugs intended for the Canadian market. Neither the White House nor the Department of Health and Human Services had an immediate response to a request for comment. Trump touted the plan in his first debate with President-elect, Joe Biden, who has also said during his campaign that he would set up a similar import plan to try to reduce prescription drug costs for Americans. --Reuters--
