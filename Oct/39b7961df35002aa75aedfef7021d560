Emery Mwazulu Diyabanza said he took the 19th Century Chadian funeral staff from the Quai Branly museum in June as part of a protest against colonial-era plundering. Diyabanza intends to appeal against the $1 200 fine, reports AFP news agency. He is quoted by AFP as saying that the "judges of a corrupt government" had no moral right to prevent him "going to get what belongs to us". "We will continue the fight with whatever means we have," he added. Vice magazine has described Diyabanza as "a real-life Killmonger", a character in the Black Panther film who protests against a museum in Europe keeping an artefact pillaged from Africa. --BBC--
