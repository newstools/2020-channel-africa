Putin, in a surprise move, last week unveiled a sweeping shake-up of the political system which led to the resignation of Dmitry Medvedev as prime minister along with his government. Putin’s changes, which would amend the constitution to create new centres of power outside the presidency, were seen by many as giving the 67-year-old scope to extend his grip on power once his term expires in 2024. Opposition politician Ilya Yashin on Monday announced what he said were coordinated opposition plans for a protest march against Putin’s initiative on February 29 in Moscow. “Society needs a big and genuinely mass protest,” wrote Yashin, who said Putin’s changes amounted to a move to “rule for ever”. “It will be a political march, the main aim of which will be to call for the rotation of power and to protest against the usurpation of power,” said Yashin. Yashin said the protest, permission for which he said would now be requested from the Moscow authorities, had the support of a wide range of anti-Kremlin groups including opposition politician Alexei Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation.
