This comes after the governor of Kenya's capital, Nairobi, said he was including some bottles of cognac in food handouts for vulnerable people. “Hennessy would like to stress that the consumption of our brand or any other alcoholic beverage does not protect against the virus,” the alcohol manufacturer said. In a video, Governor Mike Sonko urges people to drink alcohol, apparently misinterpreting the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) advice. “We will have some small bottles of Hennessy in the food packs that we will be giving to our people,” Sonko says in the video. The WHO says drinking alcohol does not protect you against the coronavirus, but it does refer to using alcohol-based gel to clean your hands. “Consuming alcohol will not destroy the virus, and its consumption is likely to increase the health risks if a person becomes infected with the virus,” WHO says. Heavy consumption could also weaken the immune system or lead to death. In Iran, some people died in March after false rumours spread that drinking alcohol would help prevent the COVID-19 virus. --BBC--
