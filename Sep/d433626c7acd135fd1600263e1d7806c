The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 49 countries, was down 0.8% at 1113 GMT. European indexes fell sharply, with the pan-European STOXX 600 down 2.7%, its lowest since the start of August 2020. London’s FTSE 100 was at a two-week low, down 3.3% and Germany’s DAX fell 3.2%. Monday’s losses were in part due to rising COVID-19 cases in Europe, said Samy Chaar, chief economist at Lombard Odier. “This is not extremely new today but you do feel that in the past days it has kind of unsettled market participants a bit because they have this new threat of localised lockdowns,” he said. European countries including Denmark, Greece and Spain have introduced new restrictions on activity. Britain is considering a second national lockdown as new cases rise by at least 6000 per day. Germany’s health minister said rising new infections in countries like France, Austria and the Netherlands is worrying. Markets were also hit by a media report on how several global banks moved large sums of allegedly illicit funds over nearly two decades. Banking shares slid after the report and HSBC shares sunk to a 25-year low in Hong Kong. --Reuters--
