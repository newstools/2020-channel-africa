The Gabon international missed Saturday's 2-1 defeat by Everton in the Premier League. "Auba is not fit for (Tuesday)," said Arsenal boss, Mikel Arteta. "He will have another scan in the next few days and we will see how quickly we can get him back in the team." Arsenal have lost five of their last seven Premier League games and are 15th in the table with 14 points, their worst start to a season since 1974-75. But despite Arsenal's struggles in the league they have done well in the EFL Cup this season and have beaten Leicester and Liverpool on their way to the last eight. The Gunners won the FA Cup under Arteta last season and he believes a win against City could set them up for more trophy success this term. "This is what we want to use it for because it's a competition we want to try to win," Arteta added. "We had two difficult opponents, with Leicester and Liverpool. We managed to beat them both and now we are playing at home and we are one step closer to Wembley." --BBC--
