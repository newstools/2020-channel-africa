The French Sportswear brand replaces the team’s long-time sponsors Nike after the American brand’s deal with the South African Football Association (SAFA) ended in 2019. “We are delighted to have entered into a long-term partnership with SAFA as the new technical sponsor for the national teams. We have made no exception with regards to the quality and standard of the new kit as we take pride in the men and women who represent the country on the field,” said Roger Noades, Le Coq Sportif Sales Director. The new yellow and green kit features a design that takes inspiration from the diamonds mined in the country in the traditional yellow for their home jersey, a greenaway jersey, and a white third alternate jersey. SAFA made the new team sponsor announcement on their website and their Twitter account, tweeting: “Global technical brand @lecoqsportive have partnered with @SAFA_net to clothe all the national teams. @BafanaBafana fans will see their heroes in the new brand Le Coq Sportif gear when they take on Namibia on Thursday at Royal Bafokeng Stadium”. --TheAfricanMirror--
