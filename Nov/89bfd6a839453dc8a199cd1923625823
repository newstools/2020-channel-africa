The four attackers were shot by security forces at Garissa University, but Rashid Charles Mberesero, and two others, were convicted last year of conspiracy to commit a terrorist attack and of belonging to the Somalia-based militant group al-Shabab. Mberesero got a life sentence. Kenya's Standard newspaper reports that he had mental health problems in prison and was seeing a psychiatrist. The Daily Nation says that Mberesero hanged himself inside his cell using a piece of a blanket. The 2015 attack led to huge outpouring of grief in Kenya with people holding candle-lit vigils for the victims. Al-Shabab says it has been at war with Kenya ever since Kenyan forces entered Somalia in October 2011 in an effort to crush the militants who were fighting the UN-backed government there. --BBC--
