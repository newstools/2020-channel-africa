It relates to the murder of two policemen in the northern province of Sharqiya in 2016 where their guns were also stolen. They were alleged to belong to the moderate Islamist Muslim Brotherhood, which was outlawed after President Mohamed Morsi, who hailed from the organisation, was overthrown in 2013. Five of those sentenced to death were tried in absentia while one appeared in court in Zagazig, the capital of Sharqiya, reports AFP. --BBC--
