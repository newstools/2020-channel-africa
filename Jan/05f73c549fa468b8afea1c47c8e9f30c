Angola has named dos Santos, the daughter of former President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, as a suspect over alleged mismanagement and misappropriation of funds while she was chairwoman of state oil firm Sonangol in 2016-2017. She denies wrongdoing. “At this moment, the concern is to notify (the suspects) and assure that they voluntarily come to face justice,” Helder Pitta Gros said in Luanda late on Wednesday, according to Portugal’s Lusa news agency. Failing that, his office would resort to legal instruments at its disposal, one being an international warrant. Angolan news agency, Angop, also said the prosecutor, who traveled to Lisbon on Thursday, had spoken of the possibility of such a warrant. Portuguese newspaper, Expresso, said several people linked to dos Santos were also named as formal suspects, including Mario Leite da Silva. Silva could not immediately be reached for comment. He resigned as chairperson of Banco de Fomento Angola (BFA) on Monday, according to his resignation letter, which was seen by Reuters. 

The letter made no reference to recent events linked to dos Santos, citing instead a December decision by BFA’s controlling shareholder Unitel not to name him among board members for the next three years.
