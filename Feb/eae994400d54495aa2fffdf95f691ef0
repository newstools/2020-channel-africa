Fédération Internationale de Football Association (Fifa) says that a number of matches in the 2019 Kenyan Premier League season were manipulated. Kenyans Moses Chikati, Festus Okiring and Festo Omukoto have been banned from taking part in any kind of football-related activity at national and international level, administrative, sports or any other, for four years, while Ugandan George Mandela has been handed a lifetime ban from all football related activities. The four players were at the time playing for Kakamega Homeboyz. "The formal disciplinary proceedings against the aforementioned individuals stemmed from an investigation into various matches from the Kenyan Premier League in 2019," a statement from Fifa's Disciplinary Committee stated. "I pity the affected players," added Homeboyz owner Cleophas Shimanyula, who was the whistle blower of this vice. --TheEastAfrican--
