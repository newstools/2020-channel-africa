The Swiss master was rattled by the all-guns-blazing Australian, but finally scraped past him 4-6, 7-6 (7/2), 6-4, 4-6, 7-6 (10/8) to stay alive in his quest for a 21 Grand Slam title. He will now take on unseeded Hungarian Marton Fucsovics, who eased past American Tommy Paul in straight sets, for a place in the last eight. "It was tough tonight, thank God it was a super breaker," said the third seed, who looked out for the count when he was down 8-4 in the best-of-10 fifth set super tiebreaker. "He played a great match - I can't even speak any more. "It came down to the wire. I was getting ready to explain myself in the press conference. What a match. "I had to figure out a way to get him in trouble on his serve," he added. "He was doing such a nice job of not making many mistakes. I never really felt comfortable." The win handed him not only a 100 victory at Melbourne Park but gave him the distinction of becoming the only player, man or woman, to post a century of victories at two different Slams. The Swiss great notched three figures at Wimbledon last year. He is one of only four players in the 100 club - Martina Navratilova at Wimbledon, and Chris Evert and Serena Williams at the US Open are the others. But it nearly didn't happen against the 47 ranked Australian Millman, who memorably beat Federer over four gruelling sets in the round of 16 at the US Open in 2018.
