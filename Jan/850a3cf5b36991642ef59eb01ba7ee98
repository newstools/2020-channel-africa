Telkom, in which the government holds a stake of about 39%, has over billions worth of debt and is struggling with declining performance in fixed voice and fixed data services. Telkom spokesperson, Noma Faku says, “As things stand right now, the consultation process is starting with the trade unions. It is facilitated by the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) and that process will come out with a final number.” “Part of that process, we have put forward a number of 3000 as part of the review which takes 60 days. So if the trade unions come up with alternatives that they will table through the CCMA process in the next few days, that number may change. In the conversations that we are starting today, we are looking at Openserve and the consumer division.” Faku says the firm requires less staff as they embark on modernising technologies.
