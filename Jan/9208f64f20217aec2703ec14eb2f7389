More than 14 000 UN peacekeepers are in the country, where armed groups still hold sway. According to the AFP news agency, Djotodia was welcomed at a hotel in the capital, Bangui, by some of his supporters and was given an escort by the security forces on Friday morning. He is quoted as telling journalists that “2020 will be a year of peace. I am no longer a man of war, I am a man of peace.” “I urge all the rebels to be patient. There is a peace agreement which has been signed. It is time for all of us, fighters and all Central Africans, to stand up to pacify the country." The most recent peace deal was signed in February last year, which has lessened the intensity of the violence but not ended it, AFP reports. Djotodia is expected to meet President Faustin-Archange Touadera, who won elections in 2016, later on Friday, the agency says. The next presidential elections are scheduled to take place in December. --BBC--
