The 51-year-old Lee expressed regret for the group’s failure to strictly abide by the law and ethics, in his first news conference in five years. The Vice Chairperson of Samsung Electronics has been embroiled in a bribery scandal involving South Korea’s impeached president and which prosecutors said was aimed at smoothing business succession. “Samsung failed to live up to public expectations. We have caused disappointments and concerns,” the 51-year-old Lee said at a Samsung office in southern Seoul. He also apologised for the behaviour of executives caught sabotaging labour union activities. The Supreme Court in August overturned an appeals court ruling on the bribery case, raising the possibility of a tougher sentence and potential return to jail for the chief of South Korea’s biggest conglomerate.

Some of Samsung Group’s former and current executives have been investigated and convicted in other cases.
