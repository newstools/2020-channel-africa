Turkish President, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, have called for a ceasefire to end the conflict in Libya.The two leaders are seen to back rival sides in a conflict dragging in an increasing number of states. After talks in Istanbul, Erdogan and Putin said the ceasefire should come into force at midnight on Sunday. The call came amid a warning by German Foreign Minister, Heiko Maas of a Syrian-style civil war in Libya. Last week, Turkey sent troops to the North African state to bolster the embattled United Nations-backed government.
