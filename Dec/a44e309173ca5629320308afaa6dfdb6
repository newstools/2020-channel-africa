The survey was done in partnership with the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Researchers spoke to 15 000 people in 15 countries across the continent. They noticed a variation of results ranging from 94% acceptance of the vaccine in Ethiopia to 59% in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Those who didn't want to get the vaccine were mostly worried about its safety, while others also queried the case for taking vaccines in general. Africa CDC says that much of the distrust was based on "misinformation and disinformation, as most of those who said they would not take a vaccine believe that the disease is man-made, does not exist, or is exaggerated and does not pose a serious threat". Researchers found that older people, those in rural areas and those who knew someone who had tested positive for coronavirus were more accepting of the vaccine. --BBC--
