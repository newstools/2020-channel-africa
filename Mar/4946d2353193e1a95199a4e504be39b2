According to data from the investment platform TimBukOne, the JSE's entire share index has had just three worse days in the past forty years in South Africa. The JSE’s entire share index closed 9.7% lower at 44 303 points. The local market has now lost more than a fifth of its value so far in 2020. Across the world, markets were bleeding as investors feared the economic impact of the worsening spread of the coronavirus. Trading had to be briefly halted on Wall Street because the market fell too far, too fast. European stocks were down more than 8%. The 10-year Treasury yield slid to 0.65%. The Brazilian stock market, which lost 12% so far on Thursday, lost almost a third of its value this week. Bloomberg reports that United States President, Donald Trump’s travel ban and tepid fiscal measures sparked the latest leg down in risk assets, while the European Central Bank failed to stem the rout after it left rates unchanged, though it temporarily increased its quantitative easing programme and took steps to boost liquidity.
