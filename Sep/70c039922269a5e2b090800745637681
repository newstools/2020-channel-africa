Ugandan Dr Catherine Nakalembe was awarded the prize alongside Dr André Bationo of Burkina Faso who works on improving fertiliser technology. Nakalembe won the award for her research into promoting food security in Africa. “My work initially focused on understanding drought and agricultural land use in Karamoja region in the north-east of Uganda,” Nakalembe told the BBC Focus on Africa programme. In her work, the Nasa researcher explores how to use satellite data to support food production and help inform decision making in agriculture on the continent. She said satellite technology can also be used to fight the problem of locust infestations currently affecting some African countries. “With satellites you can check soil moisture which is important for breeding of locusts.” The Africa Food Prize rewards pioneering efforts to overcome obstacles in agriculture. --BBC--
