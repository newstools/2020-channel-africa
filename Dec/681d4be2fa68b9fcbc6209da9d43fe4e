The company, whose engines power Boeing 787s and Airbus A350s, has been hit by the travel slump during the coronavirus pandemic and in November raised $2.7 billion from shareholders and took on 3 billion pounds of debt to help it survive COVID-19. It also said the recovery in engine flying hours, a key measure of how much it is paid by airlines, had slowed due to a second wave of infections in some geographies. “The outlook remains challenging and the pace and timing of the recovery is uncertain,” chief executive Warren East said in a statement. Over the 11 months to November, engine flying hours were approximately 42% of their prior year level, meaning Rolls will likely miss the base case forecast it gave in October for engine flying hours to come in at 45% for 2020.

For October and November, engine flying hours came in at about 33% compared to last year, improving on the 29% seen in the three months ended September.
