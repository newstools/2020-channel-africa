Former President Pierre Nkurunziza was accused of downplaying the issue, saying "God had cleared coronavirus from Burundi's skies", almost a fortnight before he died in June of cardiac arrest. But last week, his successor President Evariste Ndayishimiye, declared coronavirus a "major enemy of Burundians" and wowed "to start the fight against that enemy". At the launch of the campaign in Bujumbura, many people were unusually seen wearing masks. A record 640 tests were taken on the day, the highest number since March when the virus was reported in the country. Since the new President took office on June 18, more than 1 900 tests have been taken compared with only 1 200 taken before. The health ministry says the campaign testing will continue in order to show the status of the virus in the country. Burundi has so far reported 191 cases from 3 200 tests done in the past three months. --BBC--
