This, after Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings downgraded the country’s credit ratings and maintained a negative outlook. However, S&P Global Ratings affirmed South Africa’s long term foreign and local currency debt ratings at “BB-” and “BB”, respectively, and maintained a stable outlook. Cas Coovadia, the Chief Executive of Business Unity South (Busa), said the organisation hoped that the latest sovereign ratings downgrades would galvanise the country into taking urgent action to get on to the road to address the reasons raised by Moody’s and Fitch for the downgrades. Moody’s and Fitch both highlighted the high and rising government debt triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic as a threat to the country’s fiscal stability over the medium-term. South Africa’s debt was forecast to peak at 93% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2023/24 when the country will be spending almost 6%of GDP on debt service costs. Moody’s said the maintenance of the negative outlook reflected the risks that the debt burden and debt affordability could deteriorate significantly more than it currently projects. The ratings agency now projects government debt-to-GDP to rise to 110% by the end of 2024 fiscal year. --IOL--
