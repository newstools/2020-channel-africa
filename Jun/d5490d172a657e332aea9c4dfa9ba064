However, some high value Ugandans shifted from using money services to agency banking. According to the latest Uganda Communications Commission report, net additions in registered mobile money accounts between December 2018 and December 2019 stood at 2.6 million. The quarter ended with 27.1 million registered mobile money accounts, up from 26.4 million in September 2019. The figure does not represent the number of active mobile money accounts which stood at 16.6 million, according to the regulator. “Active mobile money accounts stood at 16.6 million accounts in December 2019, up from 15.6 million in September 2019, representing a 6 % quarter on quarter growth” reads the report. “Active mobile subscriptions refer to accounts that have conducted at least one billable financial service in three months,” which in this case covers the months of October to December 2019. During the period under review, mobile money agents reduced from 225 879 in September to 219 577 as at the end of December 2019 which has been attributed to increased competition from agency banking, increased bank-to-wallet-to bank transfers and increased number of merchants accepting such payment, which has kept money in the ecosystem. --TheEastAfrican--
