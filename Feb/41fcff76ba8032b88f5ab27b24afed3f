The Gambia - a popular destination for United Kingdom tourists - has been hit by a wave protests, demanding that President Adama Barrow honour the pledge he made when he took office in 2016 to step down after three years in office.

Barrow victory in elections ended the rule of long-serving leader Yahya Jammeh, raising hopes of a new era in the former British colony. Wardle told BBC Newsday radio that that there was a "lively and healthy political discourse" in The Gambia. "When I see opinions being expressed I think that this is a sign that freedom of expression is a new-found right here in The Gambia and I welcome that," she said. Wardle said the focus should be on the gains being made - including the drafting of a new constitution to prevent the abuse of power.
