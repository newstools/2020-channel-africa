At 0615 GMT, the Rand traded at 18.70 per Dollar, 0.16% weaker than its previous close. The International Monetary Fund said on Wednesday sub-Saharan Africa’s gross domestic product was on track to shrink this year by 1.6%, its worst performance on record, because of the combined effects of the coronavirus and plummeting oil and commodities prices. In South Africa, the IMF projects the economy, already in recession, will shrink 5.8%. That grim outlook added pressure to the Rand, which was already reeling after the South African Reserve Bank slashed lending rates to their lowest ever. That weakened its attraction as a “carry trade” currency, which depends on repo rates remaining high. The Rand has dropped around 33% since the beginning of the year. In fixed income, the yield on the 10-year government bond due in 2030 was up a single basis point at 10.600%. --Reuters--
