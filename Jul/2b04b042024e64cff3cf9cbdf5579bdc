"The Ministry of Health indicated that the Covid-19 epidemic has in recent weeks evolved in a very critical fashion in Madagascar with significant outbreaks in some regions, particularly the capital, Antananarivo," the Actu Orange website reports. There have been reports that public hospitals in Madagascar are at full capacity and will only admit severe cases of Covid-19. The island nation currently has about 7,000 Covid-19 cases. President Andry Rajoelina early this month reimposed a lockdown on the capital following a rise in cases. In April, he launched a herbal "remedy" for Covid-19 that was widely distributed in the country. Several consignments of Covid-Organics were also sent to dozens of African countries. However, the efficacy of the herbal tonic has been discredited by health professionals in Nigeria and Democratic Republic of Congo(DRC), after clinical analysis. --BBC--
