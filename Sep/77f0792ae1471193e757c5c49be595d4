Chasing 191, England needed 12 from the final two balls and Tom Curran hit the penultimate delivery for six. England required another maximum to win but Haris Rauf delivered a perfect wide yorker that Curran could not hit. England had earlier been 69-4 before Moeen Ali's 33-ball 61 gave the hosts hope. He was caught and bowled with 17 needed from eight balls - Wahab Riaz bowling a brilliant 19th over that cost just three runs during which he also ran out Chris Jordan. Curran and Adil Rashid were left needing to score an unlikely 17 from the final over and, despite Curran's efforts, came up short. Mohammad Hafeez had earlier smashed 86 from 52 balls for Pakistan, while 19-year-old debutant Haider Ali hit a 33-ball 53. The defeat ends England's run of five T20 consecutive series wins while Pakistan earn a first victory of their tour from the final match. England play Australia in the first of three T20s on Friday. A three-match one-day international series follows.Â
