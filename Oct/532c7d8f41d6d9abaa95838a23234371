The explosion occurred in the early hours of Thursday in Baruwa, a largely residential area. The cause of the blast is still unclear, but the emergency services say a gas emission had been identified and contained. This is the latest in a series of deadly explosions in Nigeria. A fortnight ago about 30 people, including students, were killed when a lorry carrying fuel exploded in Lokoja, the capital of Kogi state in central Nigeria. A day later dozens were injured in a similar incident in Lagos. While the reasons for the explosions remain unclear, observers say it may be because of poorly maintained facilities and a lack of efficient means of transporting fuel to petrol stations. --BBC--
