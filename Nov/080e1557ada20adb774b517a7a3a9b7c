The UAE on Sunday announced the discovery of two billion barrels of conventional oil reserves and 22 billion barrels of unconventional oil reserves. The discoveries “reflect the constant development operations carried out by ADNOC in its endeavour to reach its target of increasing oil production capacity to 5 million bpd by 2030,” Mazrouei said on his ministry’s Twitter account.
