In his address to the nation at the end of an initial 14-day lockdown, the president said that all control guidelines previously announced will remain in place. The measures include closure of national borders, including Entebbe International Airport, to passenger travel, a dusk-to-dawn curfew, and a ban on public transport. Museveni said that the extension will help health workers study the situation, and monitor about 18 000 people said to have come into the country between March 7 to 22. Air and road cargo transport are still permitted. Inter-state long-distance truck drivers, whether transiting through or destined for Uganda, will be tested at the border points. So far, over 5 600 samples have been tested and 54 cases confirmed in the country, eight of whom have recovered. --BBC--
