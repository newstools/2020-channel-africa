Both batsmen missed the first two matches of the series, Bavuma with a hamstring strain and Klaasen with a hip injury - but are understood to have been recovering well. Bavuma solidified his position at the top of the order alongside Quinton de Kock with scores 43.31 and 49 in the T20 series against England while Klaasen smashed 66 (33) in the third T20 against the same opposition. "They're going to be doing fitness tests this afternoon, so we'll have to wait and see what the outcome is. Hopefully it's positive," Proteas assistant coach Enoch Nkwe said at a sweltering Newlands on Tuesday. In Bavuma's absence the Proteas tried Rassie van der Dussen (6 off 10) and Reeza Hendricks (14 off 17) opening alongside skipper De Kock for the first and second T20s, respectively, and Nkwe acknowledged that missing Bavuma was not ideal given his current form. "We've missed him, but we have a big enough squad with good enough players that are flexible to bat in different positions," said Nkwe.
