The landmark transaction creates the world’s fourth-largest pure-play beauty company. This marks a major new step in building a purpose-driven group committed to a different way of doing business. Natura &Co, which trades on the B3 stock exchange in Sao Paulo, also expects to begin trading through ADRs on the NYSE (NTCO) on January 6. The combination of Avon, Natura, The Body Shop and Aesop significantly amplifies the reach of a multi-channel, multi-brand group that will be an unparalleled leader in the Direct-to-Consumer space, bringing beauty to over 200 million consumers across the world anytime, anywhere, every day through multiple channels, touch points and iconic brands. Natura &Co will hold leading positions in relationship selling, on and offline, through both Avon and Natura, with over 6.3 million Consultants and Representatives.  The group will also have a strong position in retail with more than 3000 stores and an expanded digital presence across all the companies. Natura &Co will have combined annual gross revenues of over US$10 billion, more than 40 000 associates, a broad and complementary product portfolio across key categories and a global footprint in over 100 countries. As a purpose-driven company, Natura &Co will have a stronger voice to advocate for causes including female empowerment, fighting the climate crisis, cruelty-free cosmetics and developing strong ties with local communities, all of which are part of its belief in a better way of doing business through positive social, economic and environmental impact. --IOL--
