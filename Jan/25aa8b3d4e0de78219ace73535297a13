The Senegal international beat Liverpool teammate Mohamed Salah and fellow English Premier League attacker Riyad Mahrez to the coveted CAF African Footballer of the Year accolade, claiming the prestigious gong for the very first time. Mane enjoyed a stellar 2019, playing a crucial role in Liverpool’s continental success. The forward helped lead the Reds to Uefa Champions League glory before playing an important role in the club’s Uefa Super Cup and Fifa Club World Cup success. The 27-year-old has already scored 15 goals and assisted 11 more in 28 appearances across all competitions this season, as Liverpool set their sights on English Premier League glory. “I would like to thank my family, especially my uncle who is here today, without forgetting all the Egyptian people as well and of course my national team coach, Aliou Cisse, my team mates with the national team and the staff at the Federation,” Mane is quoted as saying by Liverpool Echo. “I also thank Liverpool Football Club, my team mates, the staff and everybody there. “It is a big day for me.. I don’t really know how to say it but I would love to thank all the Senegalese people. They have been with me all the time and they push me to do better. “Also the people from my village. I have come very far, Bambali is a very small village and I am sure they are watching on the tv. “I am really happy and very proud to win this,” he concluded. --AllAfrica--
