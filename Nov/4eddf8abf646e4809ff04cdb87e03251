"We tried mediation, reconciliation, dialogue. All failed because of TPLF criminal hubris and intransigence," Abiy tweeted. On Wednesday, Abiy announced a military operation against the Tigray region after he alleged that regional troops had attacked a military command post hosting federal troops. The federal army is currently mobilising soldiers from across the country to join the operation. The army's deputy chief of staff has accused regional troops loyal to the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) of treason. The TPLF used to be the dominant force in Ethiopia's ruling coalition but its power has waned since Abiy became prime minister in 2018. --BBC--
