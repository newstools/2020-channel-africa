Copper output fell 11% to 588 100 tons for the six months to June 30 while cobalt output was down 33% to 14 300 tons owing to the closure of the Mutanda mine in Democratic Republic of Congo. Glencore stuck to its full-year expectations for most of its commodities including copper and cobalt but said it expected to mine 14% less coal mainly due to the continued closure of its Prodeco operation in Colombia. The marketing division, which sets Glencore apart from its mining peers, is now expected to be at the top end of the $2.2-$3.2 billion range this year. --Reuters--
