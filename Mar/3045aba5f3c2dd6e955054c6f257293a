President Yoweri Museveni said the new cases come after 197 people, mostly returnees from Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, were tested on Thursday. The majority of the people who have coronavirus in Uganda have a history of travelling to Dubai. Meanwhile business in the capital, Kampala, and town centres across the country has ground to a halt after the introduction of a two-week public transport ban that started on Wednesday. There are concerns that, as the economy slows down, vulnerable people who do not have the ability to earn an income have not been given any support by the government. There have also been accusations of heavy handedness by the police and soldiers who were seen beating people on the streets.
