Some 314 were tested in total. All the confirmed cases have been transferred to treatment and isolation centres, according to a joint statement by Ghana Health Service and the Ghana Education Service. Ghana allowed final-year students back into classrooms in June to allow them to sit exams. The first cases in schools were detected last Monday. President, Nana Akufo-Addo, last week went into quarantine for 14 days as a precaution when a member of his close circle tested positive for coronavirus. --BBC--
