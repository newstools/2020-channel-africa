Daniel Prude, 41, was suffering from mental health issues when police restrained him in March and put a "spit hood" on his head, designed to protect officers from a detainee's saliva. He later died of asphyxiation but his story has only now been made public. His death was two months before the killing of George Floyd. Floyd died in May after a white policeman knelt on his neck for nearly eight minutes in Minnesota. Global anti-racism protests were held in the wake of his killing. Tensions have risen again in the United States in recent weeks after black man Jacob Blake was shot seven times in the back and paralysed during an arrest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, on August 23, sparking large protests in the city that have turned violent. Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has called for charges against police involved in Blake's shooting and that of Breonna Taylor, an African-American woman who was shot eight times by police who entered her apartment in Louisville, Kentucky on March 13. "I think we should let the judicial system work its way," he told a news conference in Delaware. "I do think at a minimum, they need to be charged, the officers." Protesters gathered in the city of Rochester, New York, on Wednesday to condemn Prude's death. Several people were briefly taken into custody after entering the Public Safety Building, which serves as police headquarters, local media reports say. --BBC--
