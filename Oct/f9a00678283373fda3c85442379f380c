Finance Minister Tito Mboweni has revised this year’s growth contraction to 7.8% from the 7.2% estimate in June. 

Delivering the Medium Term Budget Policy Statement in Parliament on Wednesday, Mboweni says government will propose a five-year fiscal consolidation plan to support the economy and create jobs. "We table a five-year fiscal consolidation pathway that promotes economic growth while bringing debt under control. The fiscal measures realign the composition of our spending from consumption towards investment and support efforts to lower the cost of capital. Our revised fiscal framework puts us on a course to stabilise the ratio of debt to-GDP at around 95% within the next five years."

Economic growth is now expected to recover in 2021 at 3.3%. According to the National Treasury, the budget deficit will narrow from 15% in this financial year to 10.1% in 2021/22. According to the National Treasury, the budget deficit will narrow from 15% in this financial year to 10.1% in 2021/22. This will be achieved through a shift in expenditure from consumption towards capital investment. "We forecast the South African economy to grow by 3.3% in 2021; 1.7% in 2022 and 1.5% in 2023. President, by putting all our efforts into implementing the Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan, we can accelerate growth to 3% or more. This will secure fiscal sustainability and build this economy better than before."
