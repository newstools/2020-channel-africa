Long queues of both south and north-bound commercial haulage trucks, had become common a feature in the last two weeks. The N1 and the Beitbridge Masvingo Road, had become an eye sore with the truckers taking over the roads. Zimra last week introduced more queues, fast tracking of maize and other urgent food imports, fuel, explosive materials and empty trucks. Some of the measures include the engagement of other customs line stakeholders within the country and the region to synchronise services to cut delays. As of Monday there were no trucks on the major roads with most having left for their destinations at the weekend. The Shipping and Forwarding Agents Association of Zimbabwe (SFAAZ), said though the situation has improved they will keep monitoring with keen interest. “The movement of cargo has relatively improved. However, we will keep monitoring and engaging the revenue authority,” said SFAAZ Chief Executive Officer, Joseph Musariri. In a recent statement, Zimra’s spokesperson, Francis Chimanda, said the traffic situation at the borders had been heightened by the increase of transit cargo now passing through Zimbabwe. This follows the closure of transit routes by other regional countries to combat the spread of coronavirus. “We are taking steps, in partnership with various stakeholders, to improve the turnaround time and the increase has been largely attributed to the different COVID-19 testing protocols implemented by different countries in the region,” said Chimanda. “This has seen transporters diverting their trucks from some routes to and from South Africa and transiting through Zimbabwe, resulting in the increase in the flow of traffic through Beitbridge. This has imposed unanticipated strain on both border infrastructure and human resources for Zimbabwe and neighbouring country border stakeholders. --Herald--
