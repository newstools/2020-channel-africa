The Red Devils secured their place in next season's Champions League after a 2-0 win at Leicester on Sunday. That qualification was always considered pivotal to their hopes of signing the Borussia Dortmund forward. And now that their transfer budget is in place, United will up their efforts to bring in the 20-year-old. A report from Bild claims that the Old Trafford club will increase their initial €98 million($126.10m) bid for Sancho. The German giants are wanting closer to €120 million($154.40m). The player himself favours a return to his homeland but the report adds that the deal must get done within the next fortnight. Bild states that if Sancho is still with Dortmund when they go to their Swiss pre-season camp on Monday, August 10 then he will not be sold. That will put immense pressure on United transfer Chief Executive Officer(CEO) Ed Woodward, who is also working on other targets. But Sancho has always been United Manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's top target, so it would be no surprise if they broke off other business - if a deadline exists. --News24--
