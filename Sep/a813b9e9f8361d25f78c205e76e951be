Formula 1's governing body had been considering whether Hamilton broke its rules in wearing a T-shirt highlighting police brutality at Sunday's race. An FIA spokesman told BBC Sport an investigation had been ruled out. Hamilton said: "Want you to know I won't stop using this platform to shed light on what I believe is right." The Mercedes driver, writing on Instagram, thanked "those of you who continue to support me and show love, I am so grateful". He added: "This is a journey for all of us to come together and challenge the world on every level of injustice, not only racial." Hamilton's T-shirt, which he wore for the pre-race anti-racism demonstration and on the podium afterwards, said: "Arrest the cops who killed Breonna Taylor" and "Say her name". Taylor was a black woman who was shot eight times in her home in Louisville, Kentucky, by US police in March. She was one of a number of victims of incidents involving police violence in the US whose names have become rallying cries for equality and justice. The FIA was caught by surprise by Hamilton's actions - previously he had worn a T-shirt saying "Black Lives Matter", while those of all other drivers have said "End Racism".
