However, it is protected under the National Heritage Act because it is in a conservation area, the Namib-Naukluft Park, which includes part of the desert, The Namibian reports. HAN said Namibians should take a stand against vandalism to show they care for the environment and the country's heritage. Some activists on social media are calling for the removal of the graffiti.
