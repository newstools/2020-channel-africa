Saracens, who have close ties to South Africa, have been relegated from the English Premiership for breaching the tournament's salary cap. Not content at just playing in the second-tier Championship, the London club are eyeing matches against top international teams to keep their array of international stars busy. According to the UK-based The Times, discussions to face Tier 1 Test nations are going "encouragingly well", with matches against the Springboks, Barbarians and Super Rugby teams in the pipeline. Saracens played a midweek fixture against the Springboks at Wembley in 2009, when they famously fought back from 18-6 down to win 24-23. Saracens won the Premiership as well as the European Champions Cup last season before the salary cap scandal thrust the club into disarray.
