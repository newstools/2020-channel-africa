Speculation about Wolff's future with the Silver Arrows has been rising in recent months having being linked with both the top jobs at Ferrari and Formula 1 itself. 'It makes no sense' But, Briatore has claimed that neither of those job changes will materialise and Wolff will instead continue on as team principal of Mercedes. Briatore is quoted as having told Rai radio: "Toto is a shareholder at Mercedes so it makes no sense to become an employee of another team. I had dinner with Toto the other night and he's staying there. It would also not be the solution to Ferrari's problems." Briatore went on to say that Ferrari's answers to success lay elsewhere, not just needing a leader in charge of the whole operation. He said: "Ferrari needs a leader but what is really important is the car. Look at Renault. They gave a boatload of money to Ricciardo, but it would have been better to invest it in the car. Ferrari needs a car within half a tenth of Mercedes, and only then can the driver make the difference."Â
