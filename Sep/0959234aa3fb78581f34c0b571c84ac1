Pliskova, runner-up in 2016, lost 6-1 7-6 (7-2) to the world number 50. Czech world number three Pliskova was the highest ranked player here in the absence of Australian Ashleigh Barty and Romania's Simona Halep. Meanwhile, other seeds to tumble were Elena Rybakina (11), Marketa Vondrousova (12) and Alison Riske (13). But there were victories for fourth seed Naomi Osaka, sixth seed Petra Kvitova, eighth seed Petra Martic and Estonian 14th seed Anett Kontaveit. Six of the world's top ten players were already absent from the behind-closed-doors tournament amid the coronavirus pandemic. And Pliskova's exit may further improve Serena Williams' chances of a record-equalling 24 Grand Slam singles title in an open women's draw. Pliskova hit just one winner in a poor first-set performance and fell a break down early in the second - smashing a racquet in frustration - before improving her level to carve out two set points. But she failed to convert them and Garcia went on to take it to a tie-break, which she dominated. "I thought she played great tennis in the first set," Pliskova said. "She was just playing super aggressive, going for her shots. "I maybe didn't play my best. But that's how it is sometimes. I'm not a robot, so I don't have to play every day amazing." Garcia, who has won seven tour titles, will face American world number 41 Jennifer Brady in the next round. --BBC--
