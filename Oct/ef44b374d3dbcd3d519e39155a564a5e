This comes after the opposition Act Wazalendo party said its presidential candidate, Maalim Seif Sharif, was arrested while trying to cast his vote. The party also said "people were being attacked with tear gas and live ammunition and several have lost their lives". Police are yet to comment on Sharif's alleged arrest, but an assistant commissioner of police in Pemba told the BBC that police used tear gas on Monday to disperse locals who wanted to invade polling centres. Ambassador Wright has urged police to show restraint and the electoral bodies to carry out their duties with integrity. Â 
--BBC--  I'm alarmed by reports from Zanzibar and elsewhere of violence, deaths, and detentions. It's not too late to prevent more bloodshed! Security forces must show restraint, and the NEC & ZEC must carry out their duties with integrity. Let's all pray for peaceful, fair elections.
