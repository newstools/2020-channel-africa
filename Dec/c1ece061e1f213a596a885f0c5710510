This follows an extradition request from neighbouring South Africa where the couple is wanted to face charges of money laundering and fraud. A high court in Malawi is set to decide on the couple's arrest after they were released unconditionally by a magistrateâ€™s court that said there was no formal extradition request from South Africa. The court will determine the case on December 22, according to the Daily Times newspaper. The Bushiris escaped from South Africa in November, defying bail conditions that barred them from leaving the country. Bushiri at the time said his life was in danger hence the decision to leave the country. The Malawian and South African governments had to issue statements on the escape after Malawi's President Lazarus Chakwera, who was on a State visit to South Africa, was accused of aiding the pastor's escape. --BBC--
