Steyn signed a two-year contract after four seasons at Montpellier in France. He moves on July 1, the Cheetahs said in a statement. His previous teams include the Sharks in Super Rugby; Racing Metro in France and Toshiba Brave Lupus in Japan. Steyn has won 67 caps since his Springbok debut while still a teenager. The Cheetahs, who were dropped from Super Rugby three years ago, play in the PRO-14 competition, suspended since last month because of the coronavirus pandemic. “Further to the signing of Frans Steyn, the majority of the players will remain with the Cheetahs for the following season,” a club statement added. --Reuters--
