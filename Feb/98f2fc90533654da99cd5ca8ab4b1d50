Indians wore cardboard Trump masks and “Namaste Trump” hats to welcome the United States President at the huge new Motera stadium in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s own political homeland, the western city of Ahmedabad. Modi, a nationalist who won re-election last year and has shifted his country firmly to the right with policies that his critics decry as authoritarian and ethnically divisive, touts his relationship with Trump as proof of his own global standing. US officials have described Trump’s visit as a way to counter China’s rise as a superpower. “You have done a great honor to our country. We will remember you forever, from this day onwards India will always hold a special place in our hearts,” Trump said to thunderous applause. India is one of the few big countries in world where Trump’s personal approval rating is above 50%. It has built up ties with the US in recent years as Washington’s relationship has become strained with India’s foe Pakistan.
