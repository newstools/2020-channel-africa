“The first swarm crossed the border in to Kenya from Somalia on 28th December 2019. Other swarms continued coming in from Ethiopia, with additional ones from Somalia,” said Mwangi Kiunjuri, Kenya Minister of Agriculture. Kiunjuri also said that the government has managed to spray several large swarms of locusts and is currently tracking others with trained officers. The locusts, part of the grasshopper family, have led to what the Food and Agriculture Organization has termed the “worst situation in 25 years” in the Horn of Africa as the region is suffering its worst invasion for decades. Swarms formed in eastern Ethiopia and northern Somalia and have moved through the region, possibly still threatening South Sudan and Uganda. Locusts can cover as much as 150 kilometres (93 miles) a day and an average swarm will destroy crops sufficient to feed 2500 people for a year, according to the United Nations. --AfricaNews--
