The attackers, on motorbikes and in 4x4 vehicles, opened fire on people in Sokoura village who are from the Dogon ethnic group. Separate reports say several Malian soldiers were also killed. Last Friday nine civilians were killed in the Dogon village of Farabougou in SÃ©gou region and 22 others were abducted. Violence between the Muslim cattle herding Fulani and the mostly farming Dogon community has been fuelled by the growing presence of Islamist militants in Mali.
