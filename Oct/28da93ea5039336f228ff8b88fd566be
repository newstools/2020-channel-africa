The first eight months of this year saw a sharp drop in tea prices on the international market, but the country performed well at auctions. According to the latest data from the National Agriculture Export Board (NAEB), the country generated more than $93 million in 2019/2020, a 12 % growth in revenue from $83 million recorded in 2018/2019. “This was driven by a combination of quality and good prices at auctions. We focused on ensuring we produce the best quality and it paid off,” said Cynthia Uwacu, the export market development and innovation manager at NAEB. Despite the high numbers, the demand on the international market has not yet fully recovered from the effects of Covid-19. Export volumes increased by seven per cent from more than 30 500 tonnes in 2018/2019 to more than 32 600 tonnes in 2019/2020. Last year, the government came up with a policy in which farmers earn at least 50 % of the price that a kilogramme of processed tea is sold on the international market, an incentive that is boosting production. --TheEastAfrican--
