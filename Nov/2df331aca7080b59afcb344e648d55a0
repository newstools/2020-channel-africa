The examinations began on Monday and two papers leaked prompting the department to convene a meeting in the afternoon. "The investigations are at an advanced stage and details on the progress of the probe will be made public at the right time while areas of possible weakness have been identified," the department wrote in a statement. The department condemned those trying to undermine the integrity of exams and asked students to pursue honesty. “We want to reassure the public that we are hard at work to ensure that we protect the examinations. The Hawks [police unit] have been helpful in working with us and there are encouraging developments coming from their side,” Education Minister Angie Motshekga was quoted as saying. Images of hard copies of the two papers were shared online before students sat for the papers. --BBC--
