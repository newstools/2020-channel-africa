Kganyago gave a virtual lecture hosted by Wits University on the role of the central bank in responding to the impact of Covid-19. Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic the bank has deployed several monetary policy tools to assist indebted consumers and businesses, such as lowering the repo rate by a total 275 basis points, relaxing rules to allow commercial banks to lend more, and purchasing over $2 billion worth of government bonds on the secondary market to counteract "dysfunction". But critics have argued the bank has been too conservative in its approach. There have been calls from some quarters of the ruling party African National Congress for quantitative easing a process of introducing new money into the system by, for example, purchasing bonds. "Sometimes I think that if we just told people our asset purchases were QE, they might stop complaining that 'the SARB is conservative', a criticism that has somehow survived despite surprise at how much the SARB has already done," Kganyago said. He added that the conditions the South African economy is facing do not necessarily warrant "full-blown". --News24--
