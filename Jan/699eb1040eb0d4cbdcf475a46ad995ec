Small and micro enterprises were the hardest hit, with only large employers expecting a steady increase in payrolls in the coming quarter. Of 753 South African employers surveyed - across five regions and 10 sectors - the strongest labour market was anticipated in the Western Cape, where the employment outlook is +4%. This was against an overall outlook of +2%, after the data was adjusted to allow for seasonal variations. Payroll prospects appeared subdued, the survey found. While 10% of employers forecast an increase in payrolls, 8% anticipated a decrease and another 1% weren't sure. A total of 81% expected to make no changes. Opportunities for job seekers are expected to be strongest in the Finance, Insurance, Real Estate & Business Services sectors, where the net employment outlook is +9%. There are also some hiring opportunities in Agriculture, Hunting, Forestry & Fishing, as well as Restaurants & Hotels, though the latter did see a decline of 3 % points. Construction has taken a heavy blow, with a decline of 5 percentage points and its outlook at -9%. Transport, Storage & Communications is similarly bleak with its outlook at -6%. Public & Social sector employers reported the most noteworthy decline of 6 percentage points, the report said. The news was slightly brighter for Wholesale & Retail Trade, where employers reported a quarter-on-quarter improvement of 4 percentage points. However, the report noted, outlooks declined in 7 out of 10 sectors compared to this time a year ago. Lyndy van den Barselaar, Managing Director of ManpowerGroup SA, said an overall sluggish economy had taken its toll. "As we move into the New Year, the South African economy continues to be affected by subdued economic growth and a sluggish growth outlook. Policy uncertainty and a high unemployment rate remain a deep concern for local businesses who are looking to the new year with caution when it comes to their spending and hiring strategies," she said. --News24--
