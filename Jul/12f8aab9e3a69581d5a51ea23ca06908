Prosecutor Whisper Mabhaudhi accused Chin'ono of inciting Zimbabweans to join a planned anti-government protest during the coronavirus outbreak, which showed "no regard for human life", news agency AFP quoted the prosecutor as saying. Chin'ono's lawyers complained about the circumstances of his arrest on Monday and his stay in custody. A video clip recorded at the journalist's house showed the remains of the glass door that police smashed in order to gain entry. Chin'ono's reporting on alleged Covid-19 procurement fraud within the health ministry led to the arrest and sacking of Health Minister Obadiah Moyo. His arrest coincided with the detention of opposition politician Jacob Ngarivhume - the leader of a small party named Transform Zimbabwe - which had called for nationwide protests against state corruption and the country's economic crisis. The protest was to be held on July 31, the second anniversary of a general election won by President Emmerson Mnangagwa amid accusations of fraud. The government has, however, imposed a strict curfew to, it says, curb the spread of coronavirus. Bail hearings for Ngarivhume and Chinâ€™ono will continue on Thursday. --BBC--
