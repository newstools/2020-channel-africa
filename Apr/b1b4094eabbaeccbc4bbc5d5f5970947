“With most Zimbabweans already struggling to put food on the table, the COVID-19 pandemic risks even wider and deeper desperation,” Eddie Rowe, World Food Programme Director for Zimbabwe, said in a statement. “We must all do our utmost to prevent this tragedy turning into a catastrophe.” Meanwhile, the World Bank has forecast that the sub-Saharan Africa region's economic growth for 2020 will contract and go into recession for the first time in 25 years because of the impact of the coronavirus outbreak.

The report also says the coronavirus will cost sub-Saharan Africa $37 billion to $79 billion in output losses this year due in part to trade and value chain disruption. --Reuters--
