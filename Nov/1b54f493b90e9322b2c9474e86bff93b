He said the new set of examinations should be done before the end of January. Chakwera told journalists in the capital, Lilongwe, that he had given the Minister of Education one week to investigate how the exams were leaked. He termed the leakage as a "deliberate act". The President has also ordered the examinations board to replace those found responsible for the leakage. Riots broke out on Wednesday in many parts of the country as angry pupils protested against the cancellation of the exams. Nearly 40 pupils, along with a teacher and businessman, have been arrested for allegedly being in possession of the leaked papers. The leaked exam papers were for English, geography, biology, chemistry and mathematics. --BBC--
