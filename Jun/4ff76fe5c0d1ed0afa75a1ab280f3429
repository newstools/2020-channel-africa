The move is to prevent people gathering there to commemorate a massacre that took place at the site a year ago. More than 100 people were killed on June 3 last year, when the army attacked and cleared a protest camp opposite the army headquarters. The pro-democracy protesters had been there for weeks, demanding a quick transition to civilian rule after the ousting of president Omar al Bashir in April last year by a Transitional Military Council. --BBC--
