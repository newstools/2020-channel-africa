European equities rose after better-than-expected German manufacturing data, giving oil a boost. The American Petroleum Institute said US inventories of gasoline and distillate fuel dropped, while those of crude rose. “The rebound in risk appetite today is lifting oil prices a little,” said Craig Erlam, analyst at broker OANDA. “But it already faces stiff resistance.”
Brent crude was up 8 cents, or 0.2%, at $41.80 at 1155 GMT, reversing an earlier drop.   

US West Texas Intermediate crude was up 9 cents at $39.89. Both contracts fell more than 4% on Monday, though they rose on Tuesday. In focus at 1430 GMT will be the official US inventory numbers from the Energy Information Administration to see if they confirm the report from the API, an industry group. Surging COVID-19 infections in countries including India, France and Spain and new restrictions in Britain have renewed worries about demand, just as more supply may come from Libya. In the United States, the death toll has passed 200 000. “Oil prices are still faring comparatively well today given all the headwinds they are facing, a firm US dollar, concerns about demand, rising supply,” said Carsten Fritsch of Commerzbank.
