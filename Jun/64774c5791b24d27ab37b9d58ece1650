The case was initially set down for May, but was postponed after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. It is expected that the Pietermaritzburg High Court will hear submissions from the state and defence teams setting down a trial date. This after the Supreme Court of Appeal dismissed an application for leave to appeal by Zuma for a permanent stay of prosecution. Zuma faces 16 charges of fraud, corruption, money laundering and racketeering that is linked to South Africa’s 1999 multi-billion rand arms deal package, while his co-accused, the French arms company Thales, is facing two charges. In the e-mails, State Prosecutor Advocate Billy Downer proposed to Jappie that Zuma’s trial begin in 2021. When the letter reportedly leaked, Zuma’s lawyer said they found the correspondence suspicious. Zuma’s lawyer, Eric Mabuza, registered his concern about communication between the NPA and the judiciary without their involvement. In a statement, Mabuza said the communication between advocate Downer and Judge Jappie might create a perception that the intention was to influence the selection of a judge who will preside over Zuma’s trial. However, the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) responded by saying there was nothing sinister about the communication. Zuma’s legal team wants the trial to start in October while the state proposes that it start in 2021 citing the outbreak of the coronavirus. --SABC--
