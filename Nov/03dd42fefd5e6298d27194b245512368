Perhaps the pick of regional clashes sees Senegal’s ASC Diaraf host Nigerian side Kano Pillars on Saturday, with the latter looking to better incorporate technical advisor Lionel Soccoia into their coaching team. “You can’t be making all the decisions when you just come newly into a team, there are other people who have worked with these players in the past and know them more than you do,” former Super Eagles defender Ifeanyi Udeze told Brila. “So he has to work with these coaches and carry them along, any coach who comes into a new system and tries to sideline others is selfish.” The other notable derby sees Ghana’s Ashanti Gold host Salitas of Burkina Faso, with the latter’s defender Nartey Polo revealing their desire to upset ‘The Miners’. “I was very happy when I heard the news that we are going to play against Ashanti Gold in the Confederation Cup,” Polo said. “I know Ghanaians to be the best when it comes to football and we also play good football so it will be very exciting and interesting playing against Ashanti Gold”. “I have known Ashanti Gold to be one of the best teams years ago but for now I don’t know their players and the team. We Salitas are good at all aspects of systems used in football. Salitas is very sound when it comes to finances so surely qualify ahead of Ashanti Gold.” Other notable matches on the weekend include Cameroon’s Coton Sport away to UFC Sokode in Togo; DR Congo’s AS Maniema Union host Bloemfontein Celtic of South Africa; Nigeria’s Rivers United visit Futuro Kings of Equatorial Guinea; and Tunisia’s US Monastir will host Ethiopian side Fasil Kenema. The return leg matches will be played on the weekend of 4-6 December, with the 18 aggregate winners advancing to join 14 clubs which received byes in the first round.  --AfricaNews--
