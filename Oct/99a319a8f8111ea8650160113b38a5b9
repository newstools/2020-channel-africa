This reflects concern with the health file as being one of the government's strategic targets, he said. The Premier Wednesday received a report from Health Minister Dr Hala Zayed on the ministry's efforts to upgrade health services offered to the citizens. The report reviews the ministry's efforts to obtain the highest international accreditation for its central labs. The central department's viruses and serology has obtained the EGAC ISO 15189 certificate for the COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. The lab is the first and only internationally accredited in Egypt and the Middle East, according to the report. The minister asserted that the ministry will continue to exert efforts to upgrade the health system with the aim to provide best health services to the citizens. The Health Ministry said Tuesday that 121 new coronavirus cases were detected, upping the total number of confirmed cases since the outbreak in the country began to 103,902. In a statement, spokesperson for the Health Ministry Khaled Megahed said 11 patients have died from the virus over the past 24 hours, raising the death toll to 6001. As many as 51 patients were discharged from isolation hospitals after receiving necessary medical care, taking the number of recovered cases to 97 449 so far, the spokesperson said. --EgyptToday--
