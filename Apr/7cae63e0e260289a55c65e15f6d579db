“This decision has been made after evaluating all the available and possible options,” Air Zimbabwe said in staff rationalization circular to all its employees obtained by Bloomberg and confirmed by the airline. Air Zimbabwe has been under administration since October 2018, but has so far failed to secure any potential suitors. With $300 million of debt, Air Zimbabwe was already facing financial trouble before the outbreak of the virus. The perennially loss-making national carrier said it would retain skeleton staff for adhoc operations and airworthiness compliance, adding that wages remained its biggest cost. Employees would, however, receive their April salaries. --Bloomberg--
