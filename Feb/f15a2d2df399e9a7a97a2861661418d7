Eight small boats were earlier reported off the coast of Dover, one of which was carrying a group of 21 men. Fifteen of the 90 "claimed to be minors", the Home Office said as it confirmed those rescued included nationals of Syria, Yemen and Mali. The migrants will be "dealt with according to immigration rules", it added. The rescued children, subject to age assessment, will be transferred into the care of social services. Temperatures at the time were as low as 2C, and the migrants are being treated by emergency services at the port of Dover, the UK Guardian reports. Ten people who made it across the body of water to Kent in the United Kingdom have been detained. --BBC--
