That is according to the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD), a Division of the National Health Laboratory Service. The death toll from the new flu-like virus has risen to 26 and more than 800 cases have been confirmed by China’s National Health Commission. The NICD says that it has put in place systems to rapidly identify and detect any imported cases in South Africa of the coronavirus. Professor Cheryl Cohen of the NICD says: “There have been no cases of coronavirus identified on the African continent and no cases in South Africa. There have been many cases reported from other countries of the world so we are really actively monitoring the situation globally and preparing for the possibility should a case be imported to South Africa. There are also a number of additional resources already on standby should we have an imported case or high risk situation and these include the South African emergency operation centre which is really an integrated coordinating centre for this type of outbreak. It appears that this virus is not very good at spreading between people.”
