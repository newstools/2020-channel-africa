The new framework for evaluating, monitoring and managing guaranteed and on-lent loans, comes as contingent liabilities such as called-up guarantees have contributed to the increase in Zimbabwe’s public debt in recent years. According to the Macroeconomic and Financial Management Institute of Eastern and Southern Africa (MEFMI), as at end of 2019, about 12.6 % of Zimbabwe’s external public debt was guaranteed and of this amount, 98 % was in arrears arising from called-up guarantees and the materialisation of other contingent liabilities. Government, as part of financing for development, offers guarantees and provide on lending loans to credit worthy borrowers. Under the guarantee arrangement, a borrower is able to obtain a loan from the lender on condition that government provides a guarantee that in the event of default, the government will take on the responsibility of repaying the loan. In the case of on lending, the government through the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development (MoFED), receives a loan from a lender or raises finance via a security issuance and then lends these funds to the borrower. --Herald--
