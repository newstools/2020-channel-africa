This is in line with the business rescue practitioners' aim to have all agreements the state-owned airline had or has for the lease of planes terminated by the end of July. A number of aircraft actually owned by the state-owned airline are still up for sale since January. These include five A340-300s and four A340-600s used for long haul flights. By mid-June, the practitioners had already returned 17 aircraft to lessors. As Fin24 reported at the timeÂ that this was because the lessors had elected to initiate the termination of the leases, according to the rescue practitioners. By having the planes returned to them, the lessors have the assets back under their control. The Cape Town Convention, signed in 2006, aimed to facilitate asset-based financing and leasing of aviation equipment by reducing a creditor's risk and increasing legal predictability in these kinds of transactions, including if a debtor goes insolvent or default. Although South Africa was among the countries who signed the treaty, it has never ratified it. The aircraft returned by mid-June included four A319s, three A340-300s; three A340-600s; five A330-200s and two B737s. Three A319s and one A330-300 are being stored in South Africa. In terms of the rescue plan, the airline will require six aircraft when restarting operations. --Fin24--
