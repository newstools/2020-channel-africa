This is according to a list compiled by the prestigious Wales Online website. Pollard, who plies his trade at French club Montpellier, shares top spot with New Zealand centre Charles Piutau, who plays for the Bristol Bears in England. The duo will reportedly be on a £1 million ($1.37m)package. The only other South African on the 15-man list is Springbok scrumhalf Faf de Klerk, who plays for the Sale Sharks in England and will earn £500 000 ($621 000). The list, however, does not include some of the game's highest-paid players who are about to see their big-money contracts expire without playing again due to the Covid-19 pandemic. All Blacks legend Dan Carter and former Wallabies star Matt Giteau were on around £1.1m($1.37m)) deals in Japan.
