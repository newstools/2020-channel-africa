Hyundai, the world's fifth-biggest automaker when combined with affiliate Kia Motors Corp , reported a net loss of $297 billion. 

The average of 12 analyst estimates complied by Refinitiv was 1.2 trillion won in profit. The years-long quality problems have cost Hyundai and Kia nearly $5 billion and left the pair subject to a probe by United States authorities over the manner of their recalls. “Third-quarter results reflect engine-related provision expenses as the company took preemptive measures to ensure customer safety and cover any possible future increase in quality-related expenses,” Hyundai said in a statement. “We sincerely apologise to our shareholders and investors for having repeated quality cost issues over three quarters since 2018,” an executive told an earnings briefing.
