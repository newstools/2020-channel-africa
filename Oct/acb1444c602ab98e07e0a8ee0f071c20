Leaked recordings have revealed that the government employee Cassius Chiwambo solicited bribes last year for himself, the chairperson of a committee which renews licenses and the then Minister of Mining, Bintony Kutsaira. The Chinese businessperson had bought shares in a Illomba Granite Mine and wanted the licence for the mine to be renewed. There are three recordings which were reportedly recorded by the miner. In one of the recordings, the miner offers to $40 000 to Chiwambo, $200 000 to the minister and $60 000 to the committee that was reviewing the mine. He added that the mining company had already drilled two boreholes for the communities surrounding the mine. The second clip is a three-way communication between Chiwambo, the chairperson of the committee and the Chinese miner. In the clip, the investor identifies himself as Joi. The chairperson and Chiwambo then demand phones which Joi had promised to bring them when coming from China. Chakwera at a press conference expressed concern over irregular awarding of mining licences in the country but did not comment on the scandal involving Chiwambo. --MalawiTimes--
