The company, a unit of Anglo American, on Tuesday reported headline earnings per share, the main profit measure used in South Africa, down 17% to R26.19 ($1.59) for the six months ended on June 30, compared with R31.51 ($1.91) a year earlier. “We are a resilient and capital efficient business with a robust balance sheet, well positioned to navigate the current environment and the longer term,” said Kumba Chief Executive Officer, Themba Mkhwanazi. The company, which declared an interim cash dividend of R19.60 ($1.19), also approved a R7 billion ($426 million) project to develop the new Kapstevel South pit at its Kolomela operations in the Northern Cape province. The project, which is expected to deliver its first ore in 2024, will contribute to sustaining production of 13 million tons for the remaining life of the Kolomela mine. During the period production dropped by 11% to 17.9 million tons compared with the same period a year ago due to the lockdown and reduced output levels during the pandemic. Kumba said sales volumes had also declined by 13% to 18.6 million tons due to weaker exports and lower domestic sales. ($1 = R16.45) --Reuters--
