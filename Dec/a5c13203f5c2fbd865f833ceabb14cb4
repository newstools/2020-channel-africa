The Mexican is out of contract for next season and his only possibility for a drive is if Red Bull pick him for their second seat. "After today, I'm determined to be here," said 30-year-old Perez. "My best option is to keep going next year but if I have to stop it is not a disaster, I can come back in 2022." Perez's team decided to replace him for 2021 with four-time champion Sebastian Vettel after the German was dropped by Ferrari. The other car is occupied by Lance Stroll, son of Racing Point's billionaire owner Lawrence Stroll. Perez, who made his F1 debut in 2011, said victory in his 190 grand prix "gives me a bit more peace with myself. What happens is not so much in my hands. I want to keep going". Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said that the team will not decide whether to keep on British-Thai driver Alex Albon alongside Max Verstappen next year until after the final race of the season in Abu Dhabi next weekend.
