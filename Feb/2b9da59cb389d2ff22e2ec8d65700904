Sharara says he warned former Douglas Warriors owner, the late Douglas Tanyanyiwa, about Evans Gwekwerere’s move to Supa Diski. “I think we are rushing to sell our gems before they get polished, most of the times it has disastrous consequences,’’ said Sharara. “It’s either they will not last long or they won’t reach their optimum levels. The players get the money but they won’t last. I personally warned the late Douglas Tanyanyiwa about selling Gwekwerere to South Africa.

“No doubt, the boy had so much potential but he had not reached full maturity as a player and it was going to be difficult for him to handle the situation. As a result he didn’t last. But then you would have to ask yourself why players like Kaitano Tembo, Alois Bunjira or Tinashe Nengomasha made it there? The 68-year-old played for Metal Box, Chibuku Shumba, Black Aces, Dynamos and Black Mambas in the years just before and after Independence. He was brought to Dynamos as direct replacement for the ageing five-time Soccer Star of the Year, George “Mastermind” Shaya, in the early 1980s. Sharara is worried by the declining standards of local football. “I think the administrators do not have patience, they want immediate results and they always try to go for quick fix solutions which usually do not work at the end of the day," he said. “I don’t see the reason why players are given one-year contracts if a club is serious about building a system that wins them things and enable them to stay competitive for long. “Every year you are signing new players. There is no continuity, whatsoever, it doesn’t work in the best interest of the club," said Sharara. Sharara said he was disappointed with the boardroom battles in the domestic football leadership. “I think we are blessed to have such a talented generation of players. What is needed now is to get the best out of these players,’’ he said. --Herald--
