The 36-year-old American, who last competed at September’s U.S. Open, notified Tour officials he was experiencing symptoms and was administered a test, leading to his withdrawal from the Las Vegas event as he begins to self-isolate, the Tour said. “Obviously, I am very disappointed,” Johnson said. “I was really looking forward to competing this week, but will do everything I can to return as quickly as possible. “I have already had a few calls with the Tour’s medical team and appreciate all the support and guidance they have given me.”

Johnson has had a sensational year, winning three times and taking home his first FedExCup championship at East Lake last month. He was also named PGA Tour Player of the Year for the second time.
