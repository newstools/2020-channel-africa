The Nigeria Association of Resident Doctors said in a statement on Sunday that theyâ€™d decided to call off the action "for the sake of humanity". It said "considering the recent coronavirus cases in the country and the commitment shown by stakeholders in the health sector" they would suspend their strike. Nigeria confirmed four new cases of coronavirus on Sunday, bringing its total to 25. The Nigerian Centre for Disease Control confirmed that all the new cases had travelled from high-risk countries in the last week. Officials have started to track down people they may have been in contact with. Meanwhile, measures to stop the spread of the disease are being stepped up. Rail passenger services and international flights to Nigeria will be suspended on Monday, and people will be banned from standing in buses if all the seats are occupied. Veteran Nigerian politician and business tycoon Atiku Abubakar has confirmed on Twitter that his son is among those who have tested positive. He said his son has been moved to a hospital in the capital, Abuja, for treatment. --BBC--
