Three of the players, Louis Paul Mfede, Benjamin Massing and Stephen Tataw have already died. The long wait was because a list of 44 names was submitted, instead of 22 players on the team. A request for just 22 names was made but then the minister in charge changed and the issue was forgotten about. An association of former Indomitable Lions players, headed by Bertin Ebwelle, revived the matter through a letter to the Presidency in June. The President signed a note giving the go ahead for the houses to the Director of Housing on Wednesday. The houses are located in the capital, Yaoundé, the economic hub Douala and the coastal city of Limbe. Roger Milla, Cameroon’s roving ambassador and one of the oldest players in the squad, has thanked the head of state for the "supreme recognition". --BBC--
