Last week the tech giant sent a memo to staff recommending that employees in Washington State to work from home. It has now expanded that request to all of its almost 100 000 workers across 11 offices in the United States (US) and Canada. Google Alphabet is the latest company to make such announcement as US coronavirus cases have risen to almost 1 000. "Out of abundance of caution, and for the protection of Alphabet and the broader community, we now recommend you work from home if your role allows," Chris Rackow, Google's Vice President of Global Security, wrote in an e-mail to workers. Alphabet said its offices in North America will remain open for those whose jobs require them to come in.
