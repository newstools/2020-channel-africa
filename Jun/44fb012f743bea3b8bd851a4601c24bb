It was confirmed last year that 2020 would be the Sunwolves' last season in the competition and their campaign ended prematurely due to the Covid-19 outbreak, while their proposed involvement in the Australian Super Rugby version was also not accepted. New Zealander Brown, who is currently an assistant coach at the Highlanders, has previously been critical of South Africa's role in the Sunwolves' demise but took his attack to a new level now that the team was officially booted out of Super Rugby. The former All Blacks flyhalf remains adamant that the Sunwolves were targeted after Japan voted for France, instead of South Africa, in a closely fought race to host the 2023 Rugby World Cup. "I just feel as though the relationship between South Africa and Japan was pretty nasty there when South Africa were really trying to get the Sunwolves kicked out of the competition," Brown said, as quoted by New Zealand's Stuff website. "I've mentioned previously the hatred South Africa had for the Sunwolves and Japan rugby around them not voting for South Africa to host the World Cup. "I think that's where it started and now we've ended up with not having the Sunwolves involved and a little bit of grey around what role Japan will play in the future of Super Rugby."
