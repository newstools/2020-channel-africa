The dollar sank as optimism surrounding an experimental drug stoked risk appetite, while expectations for additional monetary stimulus ahead of the FOMC meeting announcement weighed on the greenback. 

The dollar ebbed further in the face of a weaker-than-expected US GDP reading for Q1. At the close of local trade, the rand quoted 1.45% stronger at R18.28/$, after trading in range of R18.26/$ - R18.67/$. 

The rand extended gains in New York trading but levelled off slightly this morning. Expected range today R18.00/$ - R18.45/$.
