Motorcycling officials announced on Thursday that no development work will be allowed this season on bikes which were homologated at the start of the year. "These changes are designed to reduce the costs incurred by the ongoing Covid-19 crisis whilst maintaining fairness and equality in order to conserve the entertainment value of the sport and the integrity of the competition," the International Motorcycling Federation (FIM) said in a statement. "There will be no update of any homologated parts during the 2020 season. This applies to all manufacturers." It added: "Manufacturers must start the 2021 season using March 2020 homologated parts. Thereafter, normal upgrade regulations will apply for the rest of the 2021 season as per current regulations." --News24--
