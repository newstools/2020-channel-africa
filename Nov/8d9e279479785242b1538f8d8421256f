Seiko Hashimoto said, in response to a question from a lawmaker about Reuters’ reporting on the subject, it was the responsibility of the Japanese Olympic Committee and the Tokyo metropolitan government to explain the bid’s activities. IOC Chief, Thomas Bach, said last week no IOC rules were infringed by payments in 2013 and 2014 totalling more than $8 million from the Tokyo Olympic bid committee to an executive of the Tokyo organising committee. --Reuters--
