But the constitutional court’s historic decision on Monday to overturn the 2019 presidential election seems to have not only shaken the 19 million southern African country but the entire continent. In what experts have hailed as a step forward for democracy, the country’s constitutional court found that evidence of fraud and malpractice meant the results of the poll could not be allowed to stand. In their 500-page ruling, the panel of judges cited the widespread use of unauthorised correction fluid to alter figures, the use of duplicate result sheets and unsigned results forms as cases that compromised the outcome of the vote. They said the results announced by MEC "cannot be trusted as a true reflection of the will of the voters" and told Parliament to evaluate whether the commission can conduct the new election, which should be held within 150 days. "We would hope that everyone will play a part in order to make this a reality," said Chakwera, who had also complained of being robbed of victory in the 2014 election. "This is a landmark decision for Africa, for Malawi, for democracy and we would want to see that everyone respects that," he added. --AfricaNews--
