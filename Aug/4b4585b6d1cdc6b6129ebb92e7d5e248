Tens of thousands of homes have been damaged, several schools destroyed and water sources rendered unusable. Cattle have died in high numbers. "Since 1946 or 1948 there has never been floods like this year," Abdelrahman Ibrahim, a Khartoum resident, said. "The problem has grown big and we do not know the cause." Abdel Naser Khaer, another Khartoum resident, said he woke up to discover the flood had reached his house. "In the morning I found out that the water had flooded the house from the stream, and as you can see the walls are waterlogged." The capital Khartoum and the Blue Nile and River Nile states are the hardest-hit. Locals are left to fill sacks with earth to build makeshift barriers. More heavy rainfall is expected in August and September. In the rainy season, which in Sudan lasts from June to October, the water level of the Nile River always rises, but not this dramatically. --AfricaNews--
