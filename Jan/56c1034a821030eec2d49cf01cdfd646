In the first big test of Brexit Britain’s foreign policy, Johnson has so far resisted intense pressure from President Donald Trump’s administration to block Huawei, which the United States (US) fears could compromise British secrets. Huawei, the world’s biggest producer of telecoms equipment, denies it is a vehicle for Chinese intelligence and says the United States wants to ban it because no US company can offer the same range of 5G technology at a competitive price. After a public disagreement between US and British ministers in Davos over taxes on digital services, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said that he would be meeting with British finance minister on Saturday on Huawei. “Let me just say again, it’s a complicated issue,” Mnuchin said. “We’ve made very clear that it relates to all of the critical areas that we have significant concerns. But again, there’s ongoing discussion on these issues.”
