The Ivory Coast international has played only two league games this season, missing months of action following surgery on a tendon injury in his right quadriceps muscle last year. "The injury ... is unrelated to the quadriceps problem Gbamin had been working his way back from since August last year," the club said in a statement,gbamin-to-have-surgery-on-achilles-injury. British media reported the 25 million pounds ($30.81 million) recruit will be sidelined for at least six months. Everton are 12th ahead of the league's restart on June 17 following a three-month suspension due to the COVID-19 pandemic. --Reuters--
