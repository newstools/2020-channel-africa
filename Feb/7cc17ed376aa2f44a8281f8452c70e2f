A key item in the Budget was a proposal to cut the state's wage bill by $11 billion (R160.2 billion) over three years. Treasury proposed cuts of $3 billion (R37.8 billion) in 2020/21, $4 billion (R54.9 billion) in 2021/2022 and $5 billion (R67.5 billion) in 2022/23. Mboweni denied he was presenting an "austerity" Budget, however, telling reporters that South Africa (SA) needs to "clean up our house". Treasury said the proposed wage cuts were due, in part, to ever-rising debt repayment costs and lower-than-expected tax revenues. Payments on debt interest costs account for 15 cents out of every R1 that South Africans pay in taxes. Some form of cut to the state's wage bill was largely anticipated by analysts, who noted ahead of the Budget that the state had struggled to reduce spending by other means to stop the gap caused by weaker tax revenues. In its Budget Review, Treasury said civil servants' salaries had grown by 40% in real terms over the past 12 years, "without equivalent increases in productivity". But Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) said that the "feeble and inflammatory budget" contained a clear message to workers: "The battle lines are drawn and the attempts to shift the burden of the crisis to them is in full swing". "Cosatu finds the government’s continuous attacks on public servants silly and tiresome. Little recognition is given to the conditions facing public servants, like being overworked and underpaid," it said in a post-Budget statement.
