Ugandan Prime Minister, Ruhakana Rugunda, summoned the meeting at 19:00 local time to activate a plan the government had put in place to fight the locusts. The locusts were first seen in Uganda's Amudat district, Karamoja region. The swarms had been expected to reach Uganda and the government said it had put in place an extensive plan to combat the invasion. The plan includes deploying two hired air spray planes, as well as pickups and tractors that are mounted with motorised sprayers. Hundreds of manual hand spray pumps will also be used. Soldiers will be deployed in the exercise. The government said efforts are in place to set up cross-border spraying agreements between Uganda and Kenya. The swarms have devastated farmers in Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia threatening food security in the region.
