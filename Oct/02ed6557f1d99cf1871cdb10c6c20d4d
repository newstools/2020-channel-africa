US District Judge Carl Nichols in Washington issued a preliminary injunction on Sept. 27 that barred the US Commerce Department from ordering Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google app stores to remove the Chinese-owned short video-sharing app for download by new users. A US appeals court in Washington said all briefs are due by November 12 with oral arguments to follow. The government’s opening brief is due on Friday. Nichols plans to hold a Nov. 4 hearing on whether to allow the US government to bar transactions with TikTok that it has warned would effectively ban the app’s use in the US. Those restrictions are set to take effect on November 12. On Wednesday, TikTok sought a preliminary injunction to block those restrictions, disclosing that US TikTok users on average send 80 million direct messages and share 46 million videos a day on the app. The company said the US government has produced “no evidence that the TikTok source code has ever been compromised, shared or used for nefarious purposes; no evidence that the Chinese government has ever obtained access to any TikTok user data, let alone that of US users; and no evidence that TikTok’s recommendation engine systematically biases Chinese (or any other) political interest.”
