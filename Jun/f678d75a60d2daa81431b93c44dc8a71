Uber Cash which is available across all Uber products including Uber Eats, will allow customers to prepay for their upcoming trips or orders. "Uber Cash is another way to create a seamless experience for all our users.Â  This new option introduces a method of payment that is easily controllable, convenient and reliable," said Lits. While existing payment options will still be available including cash for rides only, debit card and gift cards, this new feature offers a seamless way to make and further control payment on both Uber and Uber Eats. This method creates a payment account dedicated to both apps that can be preloaded with any amount, to be used on upcoming trips and orders. The account can be topped-up via the customers's Ride account and used as and when needed on both Uber and Uber Eats apps, allowing the user to control the amount spent on the specific app, further helping them control their budget. Top-ups are available and work similarly to that of an airtime increases. Riders are able to top-up their balance via a debit/ credit card, an EFT or Barter for payment of use. There is no need to use a physical card or cash. Once the account has been loaded, all credit is non-expiry meaning that locals can use it whenever they see fit. Uber Cash limits potential cash deficits should the driver, courier or user not have enough or exact change, as, like a debit transaction, the exact amount will be taken. --CNBCAFRICA--
