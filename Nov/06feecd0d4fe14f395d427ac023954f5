A brief statement issued by Prime Minister (PM) Abiy Ahmed said Dr Mulu Nega has been appointed chief executive of the state. "The chief executive will recruit and appoint heads to lead executive organs of the regional state from political parties legally operating in the region," Abiy said. Earlier, MPs had passed a resolution to establish an interim administration accountable to the federal government in Tigray state. The appointment indicates Abiy’s determination to oust Tigray’s governing Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) from power. On Thursday, the national parliament stripped the governor of Tigray state of immunity from prosecution. Debretsion Gebremichael was appointed president of the state on 24 September 2020 after the regional state held its own election in defiance of the federal government's decision to delay national polls due to Covid-19.
