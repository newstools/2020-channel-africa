It has been over two years since Ricciardo, who left Red Bull to join Renault at the end of 2018, stepped on to a Formula 1 podium. So long, in fact, that the Australian forgot all about his trademark 'shoey' as he was caught up in the jubilation of his first podium for Renault - and the first for the French team since their return to F1 in 2016. I was one of Renault's drivers that first year back. The car performance was poor as the team had bought out a strapped-for-cash Lotus team late in the day, and the lack of resources meant little development work had been done through 2015. Since then, Renault have struggled to make the strides they wanted from their position rooted in Formula 1's midfield, finishing sixth, fourth and fifth in the constructors' championship through 2017 to 2019, a sizeable distance from F1's big three. There have been nearly moments, and moments of hope for Renault in the last few years. Nico Hulkenberg had a solid run before crashing out of the German Grand Prix last year, and Ricciardo had a fourth-place finish in Italy last season, before repeating that feat three more times this year, getting tantalisingly close to that first taste of champagne.
