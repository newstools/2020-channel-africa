Acting Group Executive Supply Chain and Acquisition at ARMSCOR, Sipho Mkwanazi and former Denel Group Chief Financial Officer, Fikile Mhlontlo, are also expected to testify. On Saturday, the Commission heard testimony from former South African Airways (SAA) Technical Board Chairperson, Yakhe Kwinana. The Commission learnt that Kwinana failed to declare her supplying business with Vuyisile Ndzeku. At the time, Ndzeku of JM Aviation had invested a large sum of money with Kwinanaâ€™s forex trading business. Despite this, Kwinana as the Chairperson of the SAA Technical board took part in meetings that resulted in the awarding of a R1.2 billion ($77.5 million) contract to JM Aviation and AAR Corporation. She has denied any conflict of interest and maintained that she had disclosed all her business interests. --SABC--
