Exports in September 2020 rose 9.9%, while imports grew 13.2%, official data show. The rush of imports cut China's usually meaty trade surplus - the amount by which exports exceed imports - to $37 billion from $59 billion in August 2020. Most other large economies are expected to suffer large contractions as lockdowns and public fear cut spending. But the data suggests a rapid recovery in China from an initial reduction in overseas orders sparked by the pandemic. China was the first country to be hit by the coronavirus outbreak, reporting the first cases late last year. The world's second biggest economy saw a sharp decline in the first three months of 2020 amid strict lockdown measures, before bouncing back in July. Analysts say the recovery in trade since then has been driven by a surge in international demand for home electronics, medical devices and textiles, including personal protective equipment. However, they warn some of this demand could begin to fall. In the year up to the end of September, China's combined imports and exports with other nations $3.4 trillion, up 0.7% and reversing the hit the country took in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic. --BBC--
