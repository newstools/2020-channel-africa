Molefe, who is giving evidence at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Johannesburg, says Msomi introduced her to Gupta associate Salim Essa and told her that Essa had concerns regarding getting tenders at Eskom. She says Msomi then insisted on setting up more meetings with Essa which she rejected. Molefe says Msomi stopped communicating with her after she reported the matter to former Eskom board chair Zola Tsotsi. --Sabc--
