This is after Zuma’s lawyers informed the State Capture Commission that he would be unable to appear this week as scheduled, due to him preparing for his Arms Deal criminal trial due to proceed in December 2020, and his doctors advising that he not move around too much due to the state of his health and his age. Zondo has set down the dates for Zuma to testify in November 16 to the 20.  

Zuma could be compelled to return to State Capture Commission Zuma had failed on several occasions to appear before the commission as planned due to reported ill health – hence the bid for a subpoena to compel his to return to the inquiry. Besides the former President, the Commission is set to in the coming months hear testimony from a number of high profile people including African National Congress President Cyril Ramaphosa with the probe expected to only deliver its final report early in 2021. For three days in July 2019, Zuma testified to the State Capture Commission about a long-standing conspiracy to politically destroy and ultimately kill him. He gave shocking testimony about a number of his comrades – notably former Ministers Ngoako Ramatlhodi and Siphiwe Nyanda’s complicity with the former apartheid government. The proceedings were tense with Zuma’s legal team repeatedly complaining about what it saw as misplaced attempts to cross-examine their client by the Commission’s legal team contrary to the Commission’s rule.
