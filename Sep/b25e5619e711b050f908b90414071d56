Edmund, 25, unexpectedly won the first set but ultimately struggled to keep up with the world number one's intensity. The 33-year-old maintained the level that has helped him stay unbeaten in 2020 and won 6-7 (5-7) 6-3 6-4 6-2. Norrie, 25, beat Argentine Federico Coria 6-3 6-4 6-4. The world number 76 upset ninth seed Diego Schwartzman in the first round and will face Spanish world number 99 Alejandro Davidovich Fokina next. Djokovic is seeking his 18 Grand Slam title and plays German 28th seed Jan-Lennard Struff in the third round. Djokovic has looked imperious all year, winning January's Australian Open, February's Dubai Tennis Championships, and, more recently, the Western and Southern Open on Saturday. But British number two Edmund looked unfazed and used his characteristically powerful forehand on Arthur Ashe Stadium. Djokovic repeatedly turned to drop-shots, but the tactic was fruitless as the Briton saw them coming every time in a high-quality first set. Â
