The Minister of Universities and Higher Education, Thomas Luhaka’s decision comes after at least one policeman was killed on Tuesday during clashes between police and students protesting against the increase of academic fees. The Minister has given the student 48 hours to vacate the University’s premises. Luhaka warned against those who continue to break the law.
