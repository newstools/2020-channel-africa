“Some of those who planted the bomb were killed as well as innocent civilians,” said commissioner Endeshaw Tasew. He gave no further details on the bombings, but said a police officer had also been killed in the capital during a stand-off with the bodyguards of a media magnate who was subsequently arrested.
