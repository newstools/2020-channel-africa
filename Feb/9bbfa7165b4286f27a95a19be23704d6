In a statement, Yangtze University said the student was being treated in hospital in southern Jingzhou city after contracting the illness while on a visit to Wuhan city, the epicentre of the outbreak. He had returned to Jingzhou, where he lived, on January 19, before a lockdown was imposed in Wuhan to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, which has killed more than 200 people. The BBC's Killian Ngala reports from Cameroon's capital, Yaound√© that the case has renewed concerns about the safety of some 300 Cameroonians quarantined in Wuhan with little access to water, food and surgical masks. Thousands of African students study in China. They have made desperate appeals to their governments to evacuate them or to give them more support while they are trapped in Wuhan. Last week, Cameroonians in Wuhan wrote a letter to President Paul Biya, saying their embassy in Beijing had been largely unco-operative and they were short of basic necessities.
