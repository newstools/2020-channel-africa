This is according to a report on transformation in banking released by the Banking Association of South Africa (BASA).

The report was compiled by independent research agency, Intellidex. "Top and senior management remain too white and male," Kuben Naidoo, Chief Executive Officer of the Prudential Authority at the SA Reserve Bank, commented in the report. While the majority of managers were black, the report found, most appointees in top senior management remained white. The proportion of top black senior managers in South Africa's banking industry increased from 32% to 36% from 2016 to 2018. Overall, black managers accounted for 74.7% of bank management teams during 2018, up from 72.8% in 2017. Furthermore, there was an increase in the total number of top senior managers between 2017 and 2018. The proportion of whites and blacks in top senior management increased at the expense of foreigners, the report found. "More than half of the 52 net new appointees to top senior management were whites. 

"The number of black Africans increased significantly, from 42 to 53. There was also a notable increase in the number of Indians in top senior management from 19 to 30," states the report.
