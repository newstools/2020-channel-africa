While the automaker has gradually resumed output, virus-related uncertainties remain. Just last week, a worker at its factory complex in the southeastern South Korean city of Ulsan tested positive for the virus, prompting it to shut a factory. The plant, which makes popular models such as the Palisade sport utility vehicle, resumed production on Monday, a Hyundai spokesperson said. South Korean coronavirus cases are concentrated in the fourth-largest city of Daegu and the North Gyeongsang province, home to about 20% of auto parts suppliers in the country, Statistics Korea data shows. --Reuters--
