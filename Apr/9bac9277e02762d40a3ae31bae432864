Monday marks the 13th straight day of ongoing 21-day lockdown across the country announced by the government to contain the spread of the pandemic. Authorities have imposed strict curfew-like restrictions to prevent the movement of people across the country. All road, rail and air services have been suspended in wake of the lockdown, except essential services which are exempted. The federal government has asked states to strictly enforce the ongoing lockdown to contain the spread of the COVID-19 and break the chain of its transmission in the country. On Sunday evening, millions of Indians on the call of Prime Minister Narendra Modi switched off their lights at homes and lit candles, earthen lamps, torch and mobile flashlights for nine minutes to fight what he described COVID-19 darkness. --Xinhuanet.com--
