The group says that the move could also encourage smokers to quit. It says it will soon engage with Treasury to look into their demands. The group’s Sharon Nyatsanza says if they get their way, consumers could pay almost $3 in tax per box of 20 cigarettes. “Currently tobacco tax is $1 per pack of 20 cigarettes, so this was increased earlier in the year by 74 cents. So the call for a 100% increase would then mean that tax on a pack of cigarettes would now be about $1. This is very important because it’s a win for public health and it’s also a win for the economy,” adds Nyatsanza. Earlier this year, tobacco farmers said the continued ban on tobacco products would result in massive job losses. Several protests have been staged against the ban.
