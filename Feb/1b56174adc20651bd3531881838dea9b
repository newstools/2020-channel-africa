Data also suggests that vaccinating people who are already infected reduces their chances of dying. DRC is currently battling an Ebola outbreak which has killed 2 249 people since August 2018. "The approval of the Ebola vaccine by these countries is another milestone in the fight against this unforgiving disease," said WHO Director General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. "Africa has rallied to cement hard-fought progress to keep its people safe from Ebola," he added.
