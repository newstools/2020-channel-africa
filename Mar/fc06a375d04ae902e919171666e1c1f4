Among those who have notified the Electoral Commission (EC) are Kyadondo East MP Robert Kyagulanyi aka Bobi Wine and Lt Gen Henry Tumukunde (former security minister). More people could express interest soon as some political parties are yet to convene their national delegates conferences to elect their presidential flag bearers. People Power leader Bobi Wine had, in July 2019, declared he would run for president. Earlier, in March 2019, ruling National Resistance Movement (NRM) lawmakers endorsed incumbent Yoweri Museveni to continue leading the party and the state. A month later, Uganda’s Supreme Court upheld a decision to remove an age cap for presidential contenders, paving the way for Museveni to run again in 2021 at the age of 76. Kampala-based lawyer Male Mabirizi Kiwanuka challenged the constitutionality of changes in Uganda’s presidential term and age limits, and the case at the East African Court of Justice could deal a blow to President Museveni’s bid to remain in power. President Museveni has been in power for 34 years. --BBC--
