Starting day five on 126/2 needing an unlikely 438 for victory, the Proteas quickly went on the defensive in their efforts to secure a draw that would have been a massive result in the context of the series. While they ultimately fell short, it was not without resilience as the likes of debutant Pieter Malan (84 off 288), Rassie van der Dussen (17 off 140) and Quinton de Kock (50 off 107) made things interesting for most of the day, with the draw the likeliest result for some time. Ben Stokes (3/35) was the man who rolled through the South African lower order to seal the deal for the visitors and level the series at 1-1 with two Tests to play, but Du Plessis was incredibly pleased by the resilience shown by the batters on a day where they started as comfortable underdogs. "I'm extremely proud of how we fought. You never want to lose Test matches but the challenge that we put to our group last night and this morning was that we would fight with everything we've got," Du Plessis said. "We wanted to make England do everything and anything to beat us, and they have. They've thrown the kitchen sink at us and, unfortunately, towards the end of the day there needed to be a loser. "It was a fantastic five days of Test cricket where both teams were on top and some sessions were on par. Probably for the majority of the Test match England were better than us." Du Plessis himself, though, continued his poor run of form - his scores in the series read 29, 20, 1 and 19, when he played a sweep shot to be caught at square leg on Tuesday off the off-spin of Dominic Best at a crucial stage of the game.
