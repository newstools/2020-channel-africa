Women who provide food delivery services to homes across the city have seen a boom in business, and for many Lagosians these services have helped make the lockdown a little bearable. "I had someone say to me that you know I have everything in the house but I just can’t see myself standing and cooking. People that have office lunch service and things like that and they don’t even cook at all, this has been like a life-saver for them," said Adebola Oshin, a food vendor. For many, staying at home does not mean there is enough time to cook for the family. "Food delivery services have helped me a lot because I’m at home busy. Instead of cooking three times in a day, I cook just once and I’m happy," one customer told the BBC. Tope Adekunle, who delivers groceries to homes, said business had doubled. "Before the lockdown, I supplied customers like 10 deliveries every day. But now, that there is a lockdown, I supply more than 20," she said.
