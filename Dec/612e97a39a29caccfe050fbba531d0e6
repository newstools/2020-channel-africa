Arteta said Arsenal have had “really good runs” in other competitions, where they are through to the Europa League knockouts with a perfect record in the group stage and are also in the quarter-finals of the League Cup. However, his side have won only once in their last seven league matches, scoring 10 goals in 11 league games this season to find themselves 15th in the Premier League; 11 points behind league leaders, Tottenham Hotspur. “We are very frustrated with that and we know how important it is to put those results together really quickly, because we need them straight away,” Arteta told reporters ahead of Sunday’s match against Burnley. “There have been a lot of games, especially at home, where small details have made a huge difference. But we haven’t scored enough goals and without doing that, we cannot win enough football matches. It’s as simple as that. “Creativity is linked to the chances that you are able to create in different positions around the box or the final third. We are working on different aspects that we have to improve, certainly.” Arsenal are unbeaten against Burnley in their last 14 encounters in all competitions, winning every home game in that run, but Arteta said statistics would not make a difference against Sean Dyche’s side. “Burnley are a really organised team. They are a constant threat because they are really direct but they play that game really, really well,” Arteta said. “They manage their first, second and third phases really well, the way they attack the box, set-pieces are key against them as well. “They are difficult to break down because they have been working together with the same manager for a long time, and they know each other really well.” --Reuters--
