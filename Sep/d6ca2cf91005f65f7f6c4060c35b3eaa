The programme launched on March 8 during the International Women's Day trains women to aspire to the highest levels of public leadership. Sirleaf told the BBC's Newsday programme that the objective is to increase the number of women in public leadership. “The purpose of that is to amplify the voice of women [and] increase the participation of women in public leadership roles." The programme is currently recruiting for next year and applicants have until 30 September to submit their applications. Sirleaf said in order to increase the number of women in leadership, men need to be involved and shown the contribution women can bring to the table. “What we need to change is the mind-set of men at all levels." --BBC--
