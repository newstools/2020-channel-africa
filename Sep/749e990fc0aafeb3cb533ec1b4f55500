Sun Qiang was named Nkosuohene - which means developmental chief - at Kwahu Abetifi, a town in the eastern region of Ghana. The title is given to non-royals whose efforts are deemed to have had a positive impact to the society. Photos of him being carried shoulder-high by residents were shared online, provoking comments: Linda Masarira tweeted: "What kind of nonsense is this @GhanaPresidency? Never in a million years will an African become royalty in China What is wrong with us? At this rate no one will ever take Africans seriously." Kwahu Joey tweeted: "Eno be chief. It's nkosor hene and there is no power in it. It's just to honor someone who has helped a community. It was done in Kwahu Abetifi."
