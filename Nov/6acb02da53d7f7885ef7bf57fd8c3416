Bikila Hurissa accuses forces loyal to the regional Tigray government of targeted civilians of non-Tigrayan ethnicity in a methodical way. Tigrayan officials had earlier denied that pro-TPLF troops were involved in the killings. Bikila has since told the BBC's Newsday's that the attackers had a list of non-Tigrayans to target: "There was a law enforcement operation in that area in a place called Lugdi on the route to Sudan and the forces loyal to the TPLF fugitive were severely defeated and these forces were escaping and on their way they entered a civilian village and changed their clothes from the military to civilian clothes and they massacred all the people in the area who are not Tigryans by ethnicity," he said. "Our military forces did not enter the town because they were fighting in other towns," he added. Bikila says the government has gathered evidence from photographs and eye-witnesses. Amnesty International says it has seen credible video evidence that scores or maybe hundreds of civilians were killed in Mai-Kadra. The Ethiopian President Abiy Ahmed has accused the regional government forces in Tigray of carrying out the attack. The victims seem to be manual labourers who are not connected to the current conflict in the area, in which Ethiopian Federal forces have been fighting Tigrayan state forces for the last two weeks. --BBC--
