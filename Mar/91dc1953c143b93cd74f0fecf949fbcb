ATCL Managing Director, Ladislaus Matindi, says that the company has reached the decision to suspend flights to Mumbai, Entebbe, Bujumbura, following a ban from the said countries while its Comoro route was operated for the last time on Monday. Matindi says they have suspended the routes until further notice because the countries have issued a ban on a number of countries including Tanzania from entering their airspace. --AllAfrica--
