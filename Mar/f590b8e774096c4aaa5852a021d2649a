“It concerns three Mauritian nationals who have travelled back to Mauritius recently aged 21, 25 and 59 years respectively. Two have worked on cruise ships and one is from the United Kingdom,” the Government said in a statement on its website. Mauritius, a popular tourist spot, has imposed a two-week travel ban on citizens of the European Union, United Kingdom, and Switzerland starting midnight local time (20:00 GMT). These measures were taken after recommendations from the World Health Organisation to curb the spread of the coronavirus which causes the Covid-19 disease, said Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth. Mauritians in the countries concerned will be placed in quarantine automatically if they return home, he added. Jugnauth said the government will continue to monitor the situation and act accordingly. Travel restrictions have also been imposed in the neighbouring Reunion, an island which is a French territory. --Reuters/BBC--
