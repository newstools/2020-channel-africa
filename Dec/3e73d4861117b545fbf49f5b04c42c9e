Apart from being granted city status, the city hosts the Victoria Falls Stock Exchange, and is part of a development corridor authorities envisage will attract investors in various sectors, especially in tourism. Cabinet recently considered and approved the Conceptual Development Framework for the Victoria Falls-Binga Special Economic Zone and the related nodes following a presentation by the Minister of Local Government and Public Works. The 10 nodes, most of them being tourist resorts, were identified within the Special Economic Zone as Victoria Falls Municipality Area; Jafuta (Masuwe) Stateland; Batoka Town; Mlibizi Resort; Binga Centre; Sijarira Resort; Binga hinterland; Gwayi-Shangani Dam Resort; Hwange Town; and the Hwange Aerodrome Centre. Overall, the agreed approach includes the integration of the natural environment, current eco-tourism activities and requirements relating to the World Heritage status while enhancing and diversifying tourism products on offer and integrating tourism with other hinterland economies like mining and irrigation, for example, Binga and Hwange. The development is expected to attract investors from various sectors and make Victoria Falls an international financial hub. The developments in Victoria Falls are complemented by a refurbished state-of-the-art Victoria Falls International Airport, the foreign currency stock exchange and the magnetic lure that the falls offer to tourists. Officials from the Indian conglomerate, IHD Marketplace Inc, which is eyeing massive investment in the health sector, led by chief executive officer Dr Parveen Singh, met President Mnangagwa at State House in Harare yesterday where they announced their intended investment in Victoria Falls. --Herald--
