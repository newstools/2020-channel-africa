The gathering in Moria in Limpopo province usually attracts millions of people, who come from countries across southern Africa. "On average, 10 million ZCC members gather in Moria for the Easter weekend pilgrimage every year," ZCC Spokesperson, Emanuel Motolla Motolla, told South Africaâ€™s News24 website. "And as a church we do not want to risk their lives or do anything that may escalate the spread of the pandemic." He added that the church would also ensure that its other services complied with President Cyril Ramaphosa's call for gatherings not to exceed 100 people. South Africa has so far recorded 116 cases of Covid-19, the respiratory illness caused by coronavirus. --BBC--
