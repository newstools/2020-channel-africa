Jean-Joseph Mukendi wa Mulumba was the acting head of President Tshisekedi’s legal advisory council. He is likely to have contracted the respiratory illness during his trip to France for a medical check-up.

Mulumba has been a key figure in DRC opposition politics and in human rights circles. He was a close aide of the late veteran opposition leader Etienne Tshisekedi, the father of the current President. As a lawyer he represented opposition politician Moïse Katumbi and others who opposed former President Joseph Kabila's attempt to extend his term in office. Tshisekedi took over from Kabila in January 2019, the first peaceful transfer of power in the country in nearly 60 years. Many in DRC have described Mr Mukendi wa Mulumba's death as a huge loss. Rights activist Anneke Van Woudenberg wrote on Twitter: "He was one of the greats. His country, and the human rights movement, will miss him."
