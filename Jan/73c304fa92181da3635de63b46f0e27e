The two-time Formula 1 World Champion has continued his exploits outside of the series by taking on the grueling near two-week Dakar Rally event. But despite it being completely new territory, Alonso did himself proud by finishing 13th overall alongside co-driver Marc Coma for Toyota Gazoo Racing. The high point came in stage eight where he finished runner-up, tough there were also lows to deal with such as his big crash which saw him overturn twice down a dune during stage 10. Overall though the Spaniard said he "exceeded" his expectations for the event, but if he came back in the future, those expectations would be to win.

Alonso said at Friday's finish at Qiddiya: "I have felt competitive almost every day. On this last stage, we had a puncture, we caught Yazeed [Al Rajhi] and we still finished fourth, so I think we would have been in with a shot at winning the stage.
