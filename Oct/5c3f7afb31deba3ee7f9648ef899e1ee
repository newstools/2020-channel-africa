The ban by National Electoral Commission was imposed following complaints from the ruling CCM party and the opposition NRA party. The parties accused Lissu of falsely claiming that President John Magufuli had held a secret meeting with district bosses with the intention of influencing the outcome of the polls. The ban ends on Friday. --BBC--
