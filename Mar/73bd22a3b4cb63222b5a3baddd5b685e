IMF said more than 2 000 employees would participate in a “Fund-wide remote work exercise” on Friday as part of its crisis-preparedness efforts and in preparation for the virtual meetings in April. More than 116 100 people have been infected by the virus in more than 110 countries, and 4 090 have died, according to a Reuters tally. Most United States (US) government offices remain open, but staff at the US Securities and Exchange Commission worked from home on Tuesday after an employee at the Washington headquarters was treated for coronavirus symptoms. “This exercise will allow us to further strengthen the Fund’s readiness to continue its operations and serve its membership during these trying times,” an IMF spokesperson said. The IMF and the World Bank said last week they would adopt a”virtual format” for their April 17-19 Spring Meetings instead of convening in person in Washington. The meetings usually bring some 10 000 government officials, business people, civil society representatives and journalists from across the globe to Washington. The World Bank, which has 16 000 staff and consultants in Washington, is also restricting building access for anyone who has been to Iran, China, Italy and South Korea in the past 14 days; has a fever, cold or flu-like symptoms; or has knowingly been in close contact with anyone who is sick and has or could be suspected of having the virus.
