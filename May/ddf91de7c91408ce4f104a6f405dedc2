"The government acted outside the constitution, violating unequivocally the article that reserves the exclusive right of parliament to authorise to make or grant loans," the court ruled. The loans, borrowed from London branches of Swiss banking giant, Credit Suisse, and Russia's VTB between 2013 and 2014, triggered a currency collapse and sovereign debt default. The lenders had argued in court documents that the government is liable for the money. 

The Mozambican government stood as guarantor of the loans, meaning the state would repay them if things went wrong. But civil society organisations, which brought the case to the Mozambique Constitutional Court, argued the country was not obliged to pay them back. The loans were to finance a large tuna factory and maritime security project. But hundreds of millions of dollars went missing and the supposed benefits never materialised. The United States alleged that at least $200 million was spent on bribes. Mozambique's former Finance Minister, Manuel Chang, has been held in South Africa since December 2018 over accusations he pocketed millions in kickbacks. The Constitutional Court made a similar ruling in 2019 on a $850 million Eurobond issued by another state company, Ematum. The southern African country is among the world’s poorest but has massive offshore natural gas deposits that could turn it into the world's fourth largest producer and potential for a huge energy economy. --BBC--
