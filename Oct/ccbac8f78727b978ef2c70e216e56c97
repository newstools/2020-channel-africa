Just as he had done the game against Paris St Germain, Pogba started on the bench in United’s goalless draw against Chelsea on Saturday, with McTominay and Fred playing in the heart of midfield for most of the encounter. Ince, who played 281 games for the Red Devils, believes the World Cup winner should be allowed to leave should another club come in for him. “Paul Pogba should be on the pitch, this is a big, big game,” Ince told beIN Sport during Saturday’s clash at Old Trafford. “For him to be sitting on the bench and watching, with no disrespect, McTominay and Fred playing in his position, I would be saying, ‘I must be doing something wrong if I can’t get in this team’. “But all he has done is been a problem. The fans have gone against him and now Bruno Fernandes has come in and shown what you need to do to be a Man United player. He has performed consistently and Paul Pogba hasn’t done that and that is why he finds himself on the bench,” said Ince. --IOL Sport--
