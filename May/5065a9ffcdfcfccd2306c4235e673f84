Comparatively United States unemployment stood at a 50-year low of just 3.5% preceding the impact the virus has had on economic activity and society at large. This week high-end retailer Nieman Marcus became the first major department store group to file for bankruptcy as pressure builds on similar retailers to downsize and rejig their business models as individual stories of hardship become all the more commonplace. It is the highest unemployment rate in more than 70 years. With the official number edging closer to the 24.9% rate it reached during the great depression in 1933. As lawmakers consider a fourth relief package on top of the trillions they’ve already pumped into the economy. Speaker for House of Preventatives Nancy Pelosi says: "Honour our heroes. Research from Brookings reported that one in five mothers reported their children are not getting enough food, three times the rate during the Great Depression. So in addition to putting money in peoples’ pockets, direct payments, unemployment insurance, some other tax credits, we also really need to put food on the table." But it’s the long-term damage that the virus is inflicting, with a company like Nieman Marcus already weighed down by a hefty debt burden, exacerbated by shuttered stores around the country. The writing was soon on the wall.
