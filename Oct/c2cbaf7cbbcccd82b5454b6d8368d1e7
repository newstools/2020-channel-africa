"Government has also committed R100 billion ($6.1 billion) over 10 years to the Infrastructure Fund," Minister of Public Works and Infrastructure, Patricia de Lille, said at a press briefing. De Lille also noted that R340 billion ($20.78 billion) would go to the private sector for 62 infrastructure development projects that the state recently approved. She said a number of bridges across the nation will have been constructed by 2021. "The plan is for the installation of 400 bridges in three years, with the priority provinces being Eastern Cape, KwaZulu Natal and Free State," she said. All these projects will add about 8 000 jobs. "All projects will result in major job creation and stimulation of the economy over several financial years," she said. The minister said the developments would revive the industry which suffered a 14.2% contraction due to the COVID-19 pandemic and economic downturn. --Xinhua--
