That was 111% higher than the October 2019 deficit of $134 billion and 61% higher than the previous October record of $176 billion in 2009, during the financial crisis and recession. It follows a record full-year deficit of $3.132 trillion for fiscal 2020, which ended September 30, more than tripling the previous year’s shortfall due to COVID-19 aid spending. Treasury officials said the 2020 deficit was held down partly by far lower outlays and stronger receipts in the early months of that fiscal year before the pandemic closed down large parts of the economy in March. In 2020 fiscal deficit could reach $1.5 trillion to $2 trillion if no further coronavirus spending bill is passed by Congress, said Marc Goldwein, senior vice president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the United States was on track for a $1 trillion deficit in fiscal 2021 because Republican-passed tax cuts in 2017 had reduced revenues. “If we don’t do another COVID bill, we’re headed back to the old, unsustainable deficit path we were on,” Goldwein said.
