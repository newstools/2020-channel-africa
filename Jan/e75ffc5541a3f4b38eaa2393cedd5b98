The Mission arrived in the country Wednesday to present the report. In a statement, the EU Election Observer Mission said the report will neither be shared nor published until the court decision on the elections.

On Tuesday, United Transformation Movement party leader, Saulos Chilima, who was also a presidential candidate in the May 21 elections, said the matter of the disputed elections is before the Constitutional Court which is expected to deliver its judgment in February hence he found it inappropriate for the mission to present its report at this time.
