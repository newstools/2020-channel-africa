The closure of Mitiga Airport comes a day after Turkey’s parliament voted to allow a troop deployment to Libya, deepening fears of an escalation of fighting in the North African country. Eastern-based forces led by military commander Khalifa Haftar have been waging a campaign since April to take control of Tripoli from forces aligned with Libya’s internationally recognized government. The offensive soon stalled in the outskirts of the city, but has led to increased international involvement in the conflict. Mitiga Airport has been repeatedly closed and reopened in recent years because of risks from shelling and air strikes. It most recently reopened on December12 after a closure of nearly 3-1/2 months. Flights had been diverted to Misrata, some 200 kilometres to the east of the capital. The cause of the rocket fire that shut the airport on Friday was not immediately clear. Tripoli’s main airport was closed and partially destroyed in an earlier round of fighting in 2014, when Libya split into rival political and military alliances based in the capital and the east.
