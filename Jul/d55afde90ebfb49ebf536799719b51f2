The event finally made clear the extent of Ferrari's problems with its 2020 car, with Vettel not even making it into the top ten segments in qualifying. Team boss Mattia Binotto said: "We are missing a second to pole, seven tenths on the straights alone." But amid rumours Ferrari's engine design was hobbled as a result of the cheating scandal, reporters pointed out that the new car was actually considerably slower than its predecessor in Austria in 2020. Binotto insisted: "We compare ourselves with the competition, not with the previous year." He says the problem is "a combination of the engine and aerodynamics", and said some new parts will arrive for the next race in Austria, and then a bigger update is set for Hungary. --News24--
