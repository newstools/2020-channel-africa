Hobbled by dwindling attendances and the damaging effects of a debt crisis, Greek soccer has been beset by financial problems and frequent closed-door matches because of crowd violence. Ceferin, the President of European soccer’s governing body, and Clarke are expected in Athens on February 25 to sign a framework for the restructuring of the Greek soccer, government Spokesperson, Stelios Petsas told a weekly news briefing. State Minister, George Gerapetritis met Ceferin and other officials in Geneva last week to discuss ways to crack down on match-fixing and soccer violence. Greece’s Prime Minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis also plans to meet Gianni Infantino, the President of world soccer’s governing body FIFA, this month, a government official said last week. --Reuters--
