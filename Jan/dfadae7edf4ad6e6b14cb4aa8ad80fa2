On Saturday gunmen killed 11 people and kidnapped four women during door-to-door attacks, reported Sahara Reporters and The Daily Sun. Buhari described the repeated attacks by the bandits "as a disaster". Buhari said the air raids "remain the best approach given the lack of motorised roads in the areas constantly under attack". The air strikes will support troops already deployed on the ground. The Nigerian air force is already setting up refuelling facilities at Minna, the state's capital, to support the operations. Earlier this month gunmen killed six people, injured five and kidnapped others in the neighbouring Kaduna state. --BBC--
