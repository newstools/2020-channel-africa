The South African Airways (SAA) board was announced on Wednesday. The Department says the Board will work to restore proper governance at SAA. The Board will be led by Geoff Qhena, a qualified Chartered Accountant and former CEO of the Industrial Development Corporation. Other Board members include Peter Tshisevhe, a mergers and acquisitions lawyer; June Crawford, an aviation and tourism professional; Bembe Zwane, an aviation entrepreneur; Edna van Harte, a Military Science academic and Nick Fadugba, an aviation professional. SAA employees face a bleak Christmas as they have gone for eight months without pay. Members of the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa and the South African Cabin Crew Association held a protest outside SAA headquarters last week demanding to be paid.
