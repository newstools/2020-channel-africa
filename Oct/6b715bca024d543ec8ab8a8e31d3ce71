Chief Executive Officer, Vikesh Ramsunder, said in a phone interview yesterday that although the online growth in the second half was off a low base, the platform had become their largest and fastest-growing store. Online sales growth had slowed a little with the easing of lockdown restrictions, but the growth remained “exponential”, he said. Clicks had invested in e-commerce and its digital platform over the past four years, and was reaping the benefits of this, but online trade was still low in South Africa and software, app and online platform were being enhanced continually. In addition, over the longer term, further investment in the logistical “last mile” might also be necessary, as this was currently being done by third parties, he said. “We are focused on return on investment, so we invest, then we measure its performance,” he said. The group lifted diluted headline earnings a share by 13.7% to 754 cents for the year to August 2020, results which Ramsunder said were positive in a “very difficult environment.” Earnings growth was driven by cost management, solid retail health and beauty sales and a strong performance by UPD, the group’s pharmaceutical wholesaler, he said. A dividend of 450c per share was declared, 37.6% up on last year this time. Turnover increased by 9.6% to $2 billion and taxed profit grew by 11.8%. Sales were impacted by an absence of the usual winter colds and flu, as consumers wore masks, worked from home and faced social distancing restrictions. --IOL--
