Tourism Lecturer at the Tshwane University of Technology, Unathi Sonwabile Henama, says a decline in tourism arrivals from Chinese citizens will have a negative impact on the tourism sector in the country. Henama says, in the past three to four years, domestic tourism has declined as a factor of economic growth in the country. Last week Friday, Health Minister Zweli Mkhize told reporters that South Africa was on high alert of any coronavirus cases. Mkhize said health officials remain vigilant for any signs of the virus that may enter the country. “I outlined the process of activated emergency operations centre, should there be any public health emergency declaration by the World Health Organisation. 

"That centre was activated on Thursday and is operational. We are busy building up the staff numbers that we need. This means that we have dedicated staff working exclusively on the coronavirus, monitoring and responding to detect and follow up. There will be added personnel and resources although we have already ‘capacitated’ ourselves.” Currently, there aren’t any cases of the virus that have been reported in the country. The virus has claimed more than 500 lives in China.
