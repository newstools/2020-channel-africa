Groups representing lorry drivers have been holding demonstrations to protest against the hiring of foreign drivers. On Tuesday police in Gauteng, South Africa's financial hub, arrested of some of those allegedly involved in the attacks. President Ramaphosa said the "mindless and bloody lawlessness" can not be tolerated. He directed the ministers in charge of transport and labour to investigate the attacks and submit a report. Human Rights Watch (HRW) southern Africa director, Dewa Mavhinga, has termed the attacks as xenophobic and shared a video of torched lorries.
