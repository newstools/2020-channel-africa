The ruling Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) won a sweeping majority in the October 23, 2019, polls, securing 38 out of 57 seats in parliament. The runner-up, the Umbrella for Democratic Change (UDC), which won 15 seats, had filed the suit to the high court in November, citing "irregularities in some of the constituencies". But the high court dismissed the petition the following month, saying it lacked supporting affidavits and failed to comply with rules. But Court of Appeal judge Singh Walia overturned that ruling. "I am satisfied that the applicants have reasonable arguable cases on appeal," said Walia, delivering his verdict in the capital Gaborone. "I can see no reason for refusing the applications," he added. The appeal is scheduled to be heard on January 29. UDC Vice President Dumelang Saleshando welcomed the ruling. "People who are aggrieved must be given a hearing," he told AFP, adding that "such a government" should not "be in office for a long period". President Mokgweetsi Masisi has previously dismissed the UDC claims of voting irregularities. Botswana, famed for its diamonds and wildlife, is seen by many in Africa as a beacon of democracy.
