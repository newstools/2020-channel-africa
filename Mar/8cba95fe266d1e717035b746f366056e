Uruguayan Torreira was on the receiving end of a heavy tackle from Portsmouth defender, James Bolton and was carried off the pitch on a stretcher. Ahead of Wednesday's Premier League match against second-placed Manchester City, Arsenal said in a statement that the 24-year-old was receiving "continual assessments" and his recovery was expected to take between eight to 10 weeks. Arsenal, who beat West Ham United 1-0 on Saturday, are ninth in the table with 40 points from 28 games. --Reuters--
