It is not known whether the person who tested positive was a member of his family or staff. A government statement on Saturday said although President Akufo-Addo had tested negative, he would follow the advice of his doctors as a precautionary measure. With 20,085 cases, Ghana is one of the worst affected countries in sub Saharan Africa - although it has conducted far more tests than most nations in the region. The country has recorded 122 deaths. On Friday, Ghana's deputy trade and industry Minister Carlos Kingsley Ahenkorah resigned after breaking self-isolation measures after testing positive. --BBC--
