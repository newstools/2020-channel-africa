Federer won the first set but Sandgren rallied to bag the next two against the error-prone Swiss, who received a code violation warning for obscene language and took a lengthy medical timeout during the third set. Federer’s movement seemed restricted but the 20-times Grand Slam winner and six-time champion at Melbourne Park carried on and saved seven match points in the fourth set before winning the tiebreaker to force a decider. Federer, who got involved in a lengthy argument with Serbian chair umpire, Marijana Veljovic during the ill-tempered third set, converted his first matchpoint and will meet either Milos Raonic or Novak Djokovic for a place in Sunday’s final. --Reuters--
