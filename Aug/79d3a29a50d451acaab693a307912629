Despite the effects of the pandemic, the company declared a final dividend of 65 cents per share for the year to March 31, taking the total dividend to 185 cents, around a fifth lower than the prior year. The companyâ€™s shares were more than 6% higher by 0829 GMT. The owner of the Lewis and Beares brands lost crucial trading days over the March month-end trading period with lockdown requiring the closure of non-essential retailers. It said it had lost merchandise sales of about $4.73 million and customer credit account collection. COVID-19 adjustments reduced profit before taxation by $20 million and headline earnings by $13 million, it said. This included an increase in provision for impaired debt of $7.2 million as a result of not collecting money during lockdown owed by customers who shopped on credit, and a further $11.2 million provision for the potential economic disruption from COVID-19. --Reuters--
