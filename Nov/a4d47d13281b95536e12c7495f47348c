The Young Warriors were kicked out of the tournament along with four other nations after at least one of their players failed the MRI scans done in South Africa. The tournament, currently underway at the Nelson Mandela Bay, is also used as the zonal qualifiers for the Africa Cup of Nations. Zimbabwe, Botswana, Eswatini and Comoros Islands were on Friday booted out of the regional tournament in the Eastern Cape, forcing a restart of the competition with only four teams. The Botswana Football Association have suspended their chief executive, Mfolo Mfolo, pending investigations. South Africa, Zambia, Malawi and Angola will restart the competition this week on a round-robin basis with the two finalists earning automatic qualification to the Africa Cup of Nations finals to be held in Morocco next year. A full scale investigation is need to establish how Zimbabwe ended up in the embarrassing situation. But yesterday head of the ZIFA Medical Committee, Chagonda, said they had conducted their own MRI scans to determine the eligibility of the players prior to departure and were satisfied with the results. Chagonda told The Herald that the association did everything above board, including dropping six players in the process after they failed to pass the MRI scans which were held in Harare before the team’s departure. He said he could not understand how one player was said to be over-aged after the MRI scans were again held in Port Elizabeth. Chagonda said ZIFA are willing to take the matter to any arbitration until justice prevails. “We are querying the decision and taking it to whoever it concerns because we did everything above board. “The organisers are saying the player has bones which are about to fuse. Part of the cartilage has changed to the bone. Anyone above 17 has fused bones. They are saying the particular player has partly fused bones, so that is very normal and he is still an Under-17 player.  --Herald--
