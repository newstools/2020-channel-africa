The department said heavy rains are expected in the capital Nairobi and also in western and eastern regions. Dozens of people have already died in western Kenya after mudslides over the weekend. Heavy rains have also been reported in Uganda and the county's President Yoweri Museveni on Sunday told people to move away from Lake Victoria's shores as the levels of water had risen. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, thousands have been displaced and dozens killed in flooding in the eastern part of the country. The East African region had abnormally heavy rainfall in November and December 2019 that led to flooding. Experts warn that the ongoing rains could be abnormally heavy as well.
