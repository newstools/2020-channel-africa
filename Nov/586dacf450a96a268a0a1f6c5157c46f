The UN's Libya envoy, Stephanie Williams, said no names were discussed during the week-long meeting. "We have agreed to reconvene in about a week in a virtual meeting (to) agree on the selection mechanism for the coming authority," she said. During the talks involving delegates from rival sides, a “preliminary agreement to a roadmap” for elections was reached. The talks are being held in neighbouring Tunisia. The political peace talks started on Monday following last month’s ceasefire agreement signed between the warring sides in Geneva. --BBC--
