The indicative date for allowing crowds in stadiums had already been pushed back from 14 September. Further pilot events are on hold with the situation to be reviewed again in three weeks. It means Scotland's Euro 2020 play-off semi-final with Israel on 8 October will be behind closed doors. So, too, will be the Nations League visit of Slovakia three days later. And hopes of having fans inside Celtic Park for the first Old Firm game of the season on 17 October have dwindled further, too. Speaking to the Scottish Parliament, Ms Sturgeon said: "It's important I indicate today that the route map changes with an indicative date of October 5 are unlikely now to go ahead on that timescale." Next week's Scottish Open golf was scheduled to have 650 fans on both Saturday and Sunday, but it is unclear if that will still be the case. The tournament, at the Renaissance Club in East Lothian, is due to be the first European Tour event played in front of spectators since March. Earlier on Tuesday, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced new restrictions to combat coronavirus which could last for up to six months.
