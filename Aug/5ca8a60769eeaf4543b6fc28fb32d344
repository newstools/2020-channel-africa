The militants, known locally as al-Shabab, although it has no known links to the Somali jihadi group of the same name, have been attacking remote villages across the province over the past two years. Head of US special operations in Africa, Major-General Dagvin Anderson, told journalists that the group is receiving external support that is making it more dangerous. "We have seen them over the last 12 to 18 months develop in their capabilities, become more aggressive, and use techniques and procedures that are common in other parts of the world, in the Middle East, that are associated with Islamic State," Anderson told a virtual media briefing. "We do believe there are external actors that are influencing that and making that more virulent and more dangerous up in the Cabo Delgado region." --BBCâ€”
