The United States (US) automaker’s Chongqing-based venture with Changan said on Monday its sales jumped 7.7% from a year earlier. It did not disclose the number of vehicles sold. Ford’s new SUV models including Escape, Edge and Explorer are selling well and contributed to growth in past months, it said in a statement. Jiangling Motors Corp (JMC), in which Ford owns a stake, said in a filing last week that it sold 39 192 vehicles in June, up 67% year on year. JMC sells Ford-branded sport-utility vehicles (SUV) and vans as well as JMC-branded commercial vehicles. The ventures also saw sales up in April 2020 and May 2020, putting the Dearborn, Michigan-based company on track for its first quarterly growth since the third quarter of 2017. It said the aging model line-up caused the sales slide. --Reuters--
