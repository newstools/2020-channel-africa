The internationally recognized government nearly walked out of talks last week aimed at creating a ceasefire in Tripoli, which eastern commander Haftar has been trying to capture. 

The government blamed Haftar’s forces for shelling Tripoli’s port shortly after the talks got under way. Since being persuaded by a United Nations (UN) envoy to stay, the government side has taken a hard line in public, saying there can be no deal while Haftar’s forces remain in place. “Our delegation is insisting that forces of Haftar have to withdraw from where they are now,” foreign affairs minister Mohamed Syala told journalists. Earlier on Monday, Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj labeled Haftar a “war criminal” at a meeting of the UN Human Rights Council, held in the same headquarters building where the peace talks have taken place. “Children have lost their right to education due to the shelling and the closure of schools because of the attacker and those who fund the attacker and provide weapons, these must be held accountable,” Serraj told the forum. Nearly nine years since NATO-backed rebels overthrew dictator Muammar Gaddafi, Libya is still without a central authority in control of its towns and cities. Armed groups patrol the streets, while rival governments are in place in Tripoli and the east.
