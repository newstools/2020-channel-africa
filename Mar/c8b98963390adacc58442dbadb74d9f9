The Dollar started out slow but soared higher in European trading amid widespread Dollar funding concerns.

Meanwhile, the Sarb is scheduled to convene for a rate-setting meeting tomorrow, at which time we expect a rate cut of 50 bps to 5.75%. The consensus is for a cut, with analyst forecasts ranging between 25 and 50 bps.

We expect that this month’s cut will be followed by a 25-bps reduction in May as the central bank metes out monetary stimulus to limit the depth of an expected contraction.

At the close of local trade, the Rand quoted 0.77% weaker at R16.64/$, after trading in range of R16.44/$ - R16.72/$. The Rand traded flat overnight.

Expected range today R16.35/$ - R16.85/$.
