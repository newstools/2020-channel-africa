Previously the country's central bank maintained a tight control. The Zimbabwean dollar was re-introduced last year as the result of a shortage of US dollars, the official currency used since 2009. But it has rapidly lost value against the greenback and created a thriving black market for those wanting to buy the US dollar for imports.

The shortage of foreign currency has led to problems including importing fuel, electricity and food. --BBC--
