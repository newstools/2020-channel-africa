Alieu Kosiah is accused of murder, the recruitment of child soldiers, and rape. He fought against Liberiaâ€™s leader, Charles Taylor, in a civil conflict notorious for its brutality. He later fled to Switzerland, where he was arrested in 2014, after evidence emerged of his alleged involvement in the deliberate killing of civilians, sexual violence and acts of cannibalism. Kosiah denies the charges. The case marks the first time war crimes charges are being heard by a civil court in Switzerland. --BBC--
