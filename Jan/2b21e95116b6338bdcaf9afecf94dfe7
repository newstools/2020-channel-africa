MTN Zambia Chief Executive Officer, Bart Hofker said, “Zambia’s number 1 network has taken the lead in the industry by introducing the Freedom bundles. We know having this choice will delight many and we believe that it will also contribute to better data adoption and digital inclusion in Zambia.” Mr. Hofker noted that the launch of the non-expiry mobile data bundles is in line with MTN’s customer first approach and is a testimony of MTN Zambia’s commitment to listen and respond proactively to the changing needs of its growing and diverse customer base. “Expiring data bundles was a key concern for many of our customers, so we made the necessary adjustments to offer more choice.” MTN Zambia Chief Marketing Officer, Seun Soladoye revealed that the new range of Freedom bundles are now available to MTN Zambia data customers alongside the other existing data bundles that have expiry dates, so customers have the liberty to choose a bundle that suits their needs and budget. “The Freedom bundles are available to our pre-paid and hybrid customers.
