Biden's "agency transition teams," named in a statement here on Tuesday afternoon, are tasked with liaising with the outgoing Donald Trump administration for a smooth transition. The names on the list will not necessarily join the new administration, although some may. They “reflect the values and priorities of the incoming administration,” the statement said. Experts on economics, the Federal Reserve and Treasury Department include familiar names from the Democrats’ deep bench of former Barack Obama administration officials to emerging voices who have argued that the US government should do more to reduce inequality. Mehrsa Baradaran, for example, who is working on the Treasury team, has argued the Fed should play a more aggressive role in establishing bank accounts for every family as way to ensure access to the financial system. The list reflects union influence, and possible use of the federal purse to boost economic growth through targeted investment. Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Simon Johnson, also on the Treasury team, for example, has argued that a core US problem is the lack of public investment in basic research, and suggested funding research institutions in middle-sized cities. Another Treasury team pick, Nancy Lee, has written extensively on sustainable development finance and the role of private finance.
