DeChambeau continued his storybook start to the pandemic-stunted season, finishing the week at 23-under 265 to claim his six position career win on the PGA Tour. He quickly erased Wolff's three-shot lead to start the day but needed three straight closing birdies to seal the victory in a thrilling back-nine duel. "I played really well on front nine and struck it beautifully," said DeChambeau. "On the back nine I got a little tight. I didn't hit driver the way I wanted to. "I got a little unlucky on 14 going into water but I was able to persevere and do my best to make three birdies coming in to win." The 21-year-old Wolff, who was trying to become the youngest two-time winner on the Tour since Tiger Woods in 1996, birdied four of his final seven holes to shoot a 71. --News24--
