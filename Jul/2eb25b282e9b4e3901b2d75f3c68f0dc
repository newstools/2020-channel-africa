Chairperson of the Medical Guild, Dr Oluwajimi Sodipo, told the BBC that doctors on the front line dealing with patients infected with Covid-19 are at risk and the government needs to act quickly to address their safety fears. They are asking for adequate personal protective equipment, insurance and prompt testing of health workers. Sodipo said that doctors working in Covid-19 isolation centres in Lagos are owed two months' wages. He added that they are also demanding the government addresses a wage disparity between doctors working with federal hospitals and those in Lagos state hospitals. The Lagos state government said it has met with the doctors and is hoping for a quick resolution. Lagos remains the epicentre of the pandemic in Nigeria. There are currently 12 427 confirmed cases in Lagos and 172 people have died of the virus in the state. --BBC--
