Earlier this month police officers assaulted and tear-gassed several lawyers who were trying to get bail for their colleagues who had been arrested over allegations of corruption. The fracas resulted in two more lawyers being arrested - they were later given six month suspended sentences. The President of the Bar Council in Cameroon, Evaristus Morfaw, said the legal profession was being targeted in what he called a systematic crackdown. He said the strike would continue for the next five days. --BBC--
