The pan-European STOXX 600 index slipped 0.4% by 0714 GMT, with energy firms, SXEP sliding 1.4% as oil prices fell on worries of fuel demand. Other growth-sensitive sectors such as miners SXPP, insurers SXIP and banks SX7P fell between 0.8% and 1%. The STOXX 600 was headed for a small weekly loss as an early bump from a rally in Chinese equities was offset by fears of more business shutdowns, particularly in the United States where more than 60 500 new Covid-19 infections were reported on Thursday. Among individual movers, Swiss duty free operator Dufry fell 5.3% after announcing cuts to personnel expenses by 20% to 30% this year as it tackles a plunge in sales caused by the pandemic. German genetic testing firm Qiagen rose 3.1% after it reported a 68% rise in quarterly earnings amid strong demand for products used in coronavirus testing. --Reuters--
