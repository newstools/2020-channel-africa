The match is at The Oval at Nelson Mandela Bay in Port Elizabeth. Zimbabwe Coach Annie Konje leads her troops into the battle knowing fully well the threat posed by the hosts Bantwana. The Mighty Warriors were beaten 0-1 by Tanzania on Wednesday. Skipper Emmaculate Msipa was sent off for a second bookable offence in the 74th minute and will miss the next match against Botswana on Sunday. Zimbabwe could still make it to the semi-finals should they beat Botswana comprehensively and other results go in their favour. COSAFA have released the fixtures for the COSAFA Men’s Under-17 and Under-20 competitions in Nelson Mandela Bay later this month. Both competitions provide a platform for two finalists to earn their place in the Africa Cup of Nations finals next year as zonal qualifiers. The COSAFA Under-17 competition will get underway on November 19 with a Group A clash between Zimbabwe and Angola. The COSAFA Men’s Under-20 Championship will start on December 3, with 11 teams, competing in a three-group format. --Herald--
