On Saturday, David Rugaza, a member of Rwanda’s Bar Association, held a press conference and said he was “chosen by Rusesabagina to represent him in court”. “There is no way he would voluntarily hire this lawyer without consulting with his own family first," a statement issued by the Hotel Rwanda Rusesabagina Foundation said. Rwanda's security agents are holding Rusesabagina - who inspired the Hollywood film, Hotel Rwanda, about the 1994 genocide - on charges of murder and terrorism. The family believes Rusesabagina, who lived in exile, was abducted from Dubai. However, Rwanda's President Paul Kagame said on Sunday that Rusesabagina came to the country of his own accord and was then arrested. A legal team - which included renowned Rwandan lawyer Gatera Gashabana as well as lawyers from the US, Canada, Australia and Belgium - had been set up to represent Rusesabagina, a spokesperson for the foundation, Kathryne Kurth, said. “Today [Monday] this team of lawyers is filing a case against Rwanda to the UN on the violations of laws in the arrest of Rusesabagina,” she told the BBC. On Sunday, Kagame said his government was “fully aware of our responsibilities, of our obligations", and Rusesabagina would be tried "in the open" --BBC--
