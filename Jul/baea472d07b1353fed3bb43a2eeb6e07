The US State Department said it was "deeply concerned" by the allegations documented by the Human Rights Watch (HRW). The HRW said that at least 180 bodies were found in a mass grave in Burkina Faso with evidence suggesting that government forces were involved in extrajudicial killings. The state department also cited reports by the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali. 

"The US has made clear that our assistance to the region must not be used in any way that contributes to violations or abuses of human rights and that without prompt and thorough action to address these allegations, Us security assistance may be at risk," the US State Department Spokesperson Morgan Ortagus said in a statement. The statement urged heads of state in the G5 Sahel, representing Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania and Niger  to investigate the allegations and hold "anyone found guilty of human rights violations or abuses" accountable. --BBC--
