Femi Fani-Kayode, who served as the aviation Minister, took umbrage at being asked about the source of funding for his week-long tour of the Southern Cross Rivers State. Fani-Kayode went to say that "I spend, I don't take", suggesting that he had the financial wherewithal to fund his political activities. The journalist can be heard apologising repeatedly. Several people on Twitter have defended the journalist, while criticising Fani-Kayode. --BBC--
