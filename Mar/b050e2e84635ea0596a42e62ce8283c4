The fuel and chemicals producer, South Africa’s biggest company by sales, delayed an investor call scheduled for Tuesday until March 17, noting that its oil price exposure for the rest of the fiscal year is not hedged. While the company has assumed oil will stay in a range of $50 to $70 a barrel, Brent crude fell as low as $31 on Monday. Its stock fell 47% by the close on Monday in Johannesburg. On Tuesday morning, the share recovered slightly by early morning it was up 5%. The company is now valued at around $4 billion which is still eclipsed by its debt burden. "If oil prices stay close to current market levels for a long period of time, Sasol may have to consider a rights issue to fund cash shortfalls," said Asief Mohamed, founder and chief investment officer at Cape Town’s Aeon Investment Management, which holds stock in the company.
