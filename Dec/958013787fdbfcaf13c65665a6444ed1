The country now has 9.5 million total infections, but cases have been dipping since a peak in September, in spite of a busy festival season last month. Daily cases rose by less than 40,000 for the third straight day on Wednesday, according to a Reuters tally. Deaths rose by 501, the health ministry said, with the total now at 138,122. --Reuters--
