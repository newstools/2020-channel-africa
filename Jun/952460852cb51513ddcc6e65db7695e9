Armin Laschet said the lockdown would last until June 30, and described the move as a "preventative measure". It is the first return of containment measures since Germany began lifting its lockdown in May. The country was widely praised for its response to the pandemic but there are concerns infections are rising again. Lothar Wieler, Head of Germany's Public Health Body the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), told reporters on Tuesday the country was at risk of a second wave of infections but said he was optimistic they could prevent it. Currently the reproduction rate, the R Number which indicates how many people one infected person can pass the virus to - in Germany is estimated at 2.76. But authorities have stressed the outbreaks remain localised. The R Number must be below one for the disease to be brought under control. --BBC--
