In the end, the rand prevailed and was stronger, but this was short-lived after an unprecedented plunge in US crude futures to below zero and concerns of the health of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un pushed the greenback higher in after-hours trading. At the close of local trade, the rand quoted 0.78%  firmer at R18.74/$, after trading in range of R18.72/$ - R18.94/$. After steadying late last night the rand traded softer during the Asian session. Expected range today R18.75/$ - R19.00/$. --IOL—
