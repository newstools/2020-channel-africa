The recalls would come after the South Korean automaker announced last week a voluntary recall plan for 25 564 Kona EVs at home starting October 16. Hyundai said in a statement on Monday it “is in the final stages of filing a voluntary recall notice with the NHTSA (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration) for United States (US) Kona EVs and will start the process of informing owners of these vehicles.” Hyundai will recall 37 366 vehicles and 11 137 vehicles in Europe and North America, respectively, according to Yonhap.   

The Hyundai statement did not mention the other markets, the total number of additional electric vehicles (EVs) it intends to recall or the dates of the recalls. South Korea’s transport ministry said last week Hyundai will voluntarily recall its Kona EVs as a possible short circuit due to what may be faulty manufacturing of its high-voltage battery cells could pose a fire risk. LG Chem Ltd, which supplies batteries for Kona EVs, said last week faulty battery cells were not the cause of fires in Kona EVs, and the exact cause had not been determined.        

It said a re-enactment experiment conducted jointly with Hyundai had not led to a fire, so the fires could not be attributed to faulty battery cells. LG Chem declined on Monday to comment beyond what it said last week.
