Religious services are banned in France because of the coronavirus crisis, which has killed more than 14,000 people in the country. The traditional Saint-Nicolas-du-Chardonnet Catholic church went ahead with their Mass - with about 40 people in attendance. Local residents reported hearing music to police. The priest was warned and booked - meaning he could face a 200 euros ($220) fine - but the worshippers were not cautioned by the police. -BBC--
