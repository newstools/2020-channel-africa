The businessman had appealed for a reduction of his jail sentence. He was a close associate of ousted President, Abdelaziz Bouteflika. The other accused persons also had their sentences reduced and Haddad's brothers were acquitted. Haddad was convicted in July for illegally obtaining "privileges, advantages and public contracts", as well as conflict of interest and squandering public funds. Former Prime Ministers, Ahmed Ouyahia and Abdelmalek Sellal, had their sentences reduced to 8 years during the appeal. --BBC--
