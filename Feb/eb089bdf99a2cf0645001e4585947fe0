Saul Niguez's fourth-minute strike was enough to give the Spanish side the advantage over the defending champions. Madrid's stadium was raucous on Tuesday with fans orchestrated by energetic Atletico manager Diego Simeone. "Atletico fans who can a get ticket 'welcome to Anfield'," said Klopp. "Emotions are important. Tonight they were obviously completely on the side of Atletico, but I am really looking forward to the second leg. "We speak from time to time about the power of Anfield and the power a stadium can have and tonight you saw that. "It's half-time and we're 1-0 down. The second half will be played in our stadium and they will feel it." Liverpool did not manage a shot on target against a resilient Atletico side, only the second time the Reds have failed to test an opposing goalkeeper since Klopp took over as manager of the club in 2015. "I have no problem with the result," added the German, who has never lost a European two-legged tie with Liverpool. "I saw so many happy faces at Atletico, but it's not over yet. "I'm not sure what we have to be in the second leg. They were going constantly to the petrol station and we drove with one tank. "I'm not sure if Diego Simeone saw a lot of the game because he was continually animating the crowd." --BBC--
