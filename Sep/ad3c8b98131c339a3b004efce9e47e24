The Australian Lotto Soudal rider timed his sprint perfectly into a strong headwind in Sisteron to squeeze past Peter Sagan and snatch victory from Irishman Sam Bennett. It is his fourth Tour stage win after three victories on his debut in 2019. "The guys did a great job keeping me at the front," said Ewan. "This is the biggest race in the world and I'm so happy to get another win and prove last year wasn't a fluke. I hope to keep coming back and keep winning." Ewan displayed excellent bike handling skills to navigate a chaotic finish, and avoid the headwind that penalised his rivals, until the last moment. The 26-year-old narrowly avoided Sagan's back wheel and the right-hand side barrier to get on to Bennett's wheel before he kicked clear with tremendous speed with 50 metres to go. "I was a bit too far forward in the final kilometre so I dropped back and gave myself a bit of a rest," he added. "Coming from behind is a bit of a risk but I got through past the barrier and had the speed in the end."
