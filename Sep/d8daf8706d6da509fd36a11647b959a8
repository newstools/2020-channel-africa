The flights, which commenced last week, will operate every Tuesdays and Thursdays throughout September and will be operated by the Jetstream 41 aircraft and later upgrade to the Canadair Regional Jet (CRJ) if demand increases. Airline director for flight operations, Captain Josias Walubita, who will be in the cockpit for some of the flights, is confident that the development will help keep Proflight afloat amid the coronavirus. “Proflight Zambia has invested in having cargo nets made and effective tie-downs procured to ensure that cargo can be safely secured in the cabin. All seats on the aircrafts have been removed allowing us to carry all types of cargo including live animals, perishables, and so on,” said Walubita. “At the moment we have scheduled the Jetstream 41 to fly cargo, and we will increase to the CRJ if demand goes up. There are restrictions on sizes of the aircraft in terms of the dimensions of the cabin and baggage hold and we are observing and taking safety precautions as the aircraft are initially passenger aircraft which will be used for cargo,” he added. Proflight Zambia’s addition of cargo makes it the only Zambian local airline operating cargo flight services. All cargo bookings and handling are undertaken through BidAir Cargo, a leading cargo airline providing express airport-to-airport solutions and related services to the courier and express logistics industry. Scheduled passenger business has declined as fewer people are travelling on domestic routes and internationally owing to the pandemic. Flying cargo is part of the airline’s attempt to stay afloat as passenger air travel diminished, although the airline hopes it will gradually increase towards the end of the year. --ProflightZambia--
