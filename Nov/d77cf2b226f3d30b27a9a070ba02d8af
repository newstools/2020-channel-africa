The official, Secretary-General Peter Tingo, tendered his resignation on Tuesday after serving in the role for four years. He accused Machar of failing to "display good leadership" and running the party without consultations. Machar’s office has not responded to the accusations. "You have run the movement without transparency, especially when it comes to decision making process. You don’t respect the institution's structures established by the movement’s constitution,” Tingo wrote in his resignation letter. He said his resignation will not affect the implementation of a peace agreement signed by Machar and his political rival President Salva Kiirin February after years of conflict. --BBC--
