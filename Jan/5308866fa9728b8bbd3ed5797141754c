Labuschagne hit 130 - his fourth century in five Tests, as Australia reached 283-3 at stumps at the SCG. He and Steve Smith, who made 63, shared a 156-run partnership as New Zealand toiled in the field. Both teams wore black armbands in tribute to those affected by widespread bushfires in Australia. New Zealand have a depleted side with captain Kane Williamson, fellow batsmen Henry Nicholls and left-arm spinner Mitchell Santner all missing with illness, while pace bowler Trent Boult has returned home with a fractured hand. There was a minute's applause before the Test began to honour Australia's firefighters. Australia limited-over batsmen Chris Lynn, Glenn Maxwell and D'Arcy Short have said they will donate $250 for every six they hit during the ongoing Big Bash tournament. At least 18 people have died in blazes across the country. --BBC--
