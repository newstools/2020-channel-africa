We expect the FOMC will maintain its extremely accommodative monetary policy stance at its policy meeting this week, holding off any new initiatives. The overlap between the meeting and the US election and the deteriorating health situation will favour a wait-and-see approach given the uncertain fiscal policy outlook. Meanwhile, the Fed’s emergency lending facilities have only been tapped to modest degree, however, policymakers view the facilities’ availability as a backstop that is key to help sustain market functioning and keep financial conditions accommodative. Therefore, with most of the emergency lending facilities slated to expire at the end of this year we look for the FOMC to extend the operational deadline for these programmes into 2021. At the close of local trade, the rand quoted little changed at R16.26/$, after trading in range of R16.20/$ - R16.33/$. --iol--
