Islamist militant fighters linked to al-Qaeda have fired rockets at three military bases in northern Mali in what is a rare coordinated attack on foreign forces. French military bases in Kidal, Menaka and Gao were hit although no deaths or injuries were reported by officials. A spokesperson said a UN base in Kidal was damaged. Earlier this month French forces killed Bah ag Moussa, a military leader of Mali's most prominent group - known as JNIM. France has more than 5,000 troops in the Sahel. Despite international efforts the jihadist violence has steadily spread from Mali across the region. --BBC--
