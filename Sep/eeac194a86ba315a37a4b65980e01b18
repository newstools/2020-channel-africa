Pliskova had 27 unforced errors and hit six double faults in the first set under the open roof of Court Philippe Chatrier as the 24-year-old Sherif, making her Grand Slam main draw debut, saved eight setpoints to win the opener in the tiebreaker. Former world number one Pliskova improved drastically in the second to level the match with three breaks of her opponentâ€™s service games and a crucial break in the seventh game of the decider proved enough. Pliskova, who retired in the final in Rome with injury before coming to Paris, sealed the match with an ace and will next meet 2017 champion Jelena Ostapenko, who earlier defeated American Madison Brengle 6-2 6-1. --Reuters--
