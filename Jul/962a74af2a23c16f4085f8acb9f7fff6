The independent panel of experts is headed by former Irish President, Mary Robinson, and includes Gambia's Chief Justice, Hassan Jallow and Leonard McCarthy, the World Bank's Integrity Vice-President. The agency quotes a report as saying that Adesina was cleared of all charges that were alleged by unnamed employees. Adesina, former Nigerian Agriculture Minister, was accused of poor governance, impunity, personal enrichment and favouritism. He has denied the allegations. An internal investigation had initially cleared him of the allegations, but United States (US) Treasury Secretary, Steve Mnuchin, personally signed a letter to the board rejecting the outcome. The US is one of the 27 non-regional members of the AfDB and its second largest shareholder. "The panel concurs with the committee in its findings in respect of all the allegations against the president and finds that they were properly considered and dismissed by the committee," AFP quotes the report as saying. --BBC--
