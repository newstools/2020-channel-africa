Tournament organisers have played down reports the world champions could join an expanded Six Nations in 2024. "It (the Six Nations) is called the greatest rugby tournament in the world and I think it is," said Jones. "So why would you want to add other teams that are going to decrease the level of competition. I can only talk from experience.

"Someone was giving me a history lesson on Scotland and the number of different things that have happened in the rivalry with England," added Jones. "So there's a lot of meaning to a lot of people for a game like this.
