The event will take place at Cape Town Stadium in front of thousands of fans. Federer is a 20 time Grand Slam winner who has just competed in the Australian Open, while Nadal is an 18 time Grand Slam singles champion. The Roger Federer Foundation aims to raise funds for  education of children in Africa. The tennis greats are expected to arrive in the country on Wednesday. Cape Town Mayor, Dan Plato, says, “Many Capetownians have never seen the world’s best tennis players competing against one another and we’re looking forward to the match, it’s good for Cape Town, it’s good for the sporting fraternity of Cape Town. 

Over 50 000 people, lots of international guests, lots of international visitors, and good for our economy, we might break a world record making it one of the biggest tennis matches to be attended, to be watched by so many people…”
