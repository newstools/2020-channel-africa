Violent anti-government protests rocked the capital, Luanda, in October leading to the arrest of at least 100 people. Amnesty International’s Deputy Regional Director for Southern Africa Muleya Mwananyanda said the right to peaceful assembly is protected by the Angolan constitution and international treaties ratified by the country. “Amnesty will be monitoring the situation closely, and documenting any human rights violations. Staging a protest is not a crime," she said. The protesters are expected to meet at a parking lot in the capital, Luanda, and proceed to 1º de Maio square.
