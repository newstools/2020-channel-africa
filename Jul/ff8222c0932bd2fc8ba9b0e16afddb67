Woods is making his first appearance on the PGA Tour since the coronavirus pandemic locked down the sport in March. He is returning at an event he has won a record five times in the past, while a sixth victory would see him achieve a record 83 wins on the PGA Tour. The 44-year-old reigning Masters champion last competed in February, before being side-lined with back issues. McIlroy has four top 10s in eight starts at the Memorial, while Koepka will be looking to bounce back from last weekâ€™s missed cut at the Workday Charity Open, which was also held at Muirfield Village in Ohio. The two other featured groups for the first two rounds of the Memorial are Phil Mickelson, Justin Rose and Shane Lowry, and Justin Thomas, Xander Schauffele and Dustin Johnson.

The two most recent PGA Tour winners, Bryson DeChambeau and Collin Morikawa, will also be in action in Ohio this week. --News24--
