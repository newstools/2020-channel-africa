The two countries agreed to collaborate in research, science and technology to find tangible solutions to battle the global pandemic. Russian Ambassador to Zimbabwe Nikolai Krasilnikov yesterday handed over the PPEs and medical items to government representatives, Health and Child Care Deputy Minister Dr John Mangwiro and Foreign Affairs and International Trade Deputy Minister, David Musabayana. Zimbabwe is in the first group of African countries to receive Covid-19 relief from Russia, which has been supporting Zimbabwe for some time now, including after the Cyclone Idai disaster. Ambassador Krasilnikov appreciated the organised and effective measures being undertaken by Zimbabwe in the battle to curb the rapid spread of Covid-19. He said the goods received yesterday were aimed at boosting Zimbabwe’s capacity to fight Covid-19. “This is not the end of the story. We know that Zimbabwe has a great potential in this field of science and technology so together with our Zimbabwean counterparts, we are working out on launching modalities to start practical cooperation in the field of medicine and pharmaceuticals to make an input into the global efforts to curb the pandemic,” he said. “This work has been done to implement the decision of the Russia–Africa Economic Forum and Summit last year to implement the highest level agreements between President Putin and President Mnangagwa and to implement the decision of the inter-governmental commission on economic, scientific and technical cooperation. “We have got wonderful prospects ahead of us and we are ready to walk along this road together with our Zimbabwean friends to join all our efforts to find together tangible solution to the problems caused by the pandemic.”  --Herald--
