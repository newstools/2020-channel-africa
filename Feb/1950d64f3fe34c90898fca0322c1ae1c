The 17-time Grand Slam winner had previously announced he would only compete in the Madrid Open and Italian Open as part of his Roland Garros preparation. Djokovic is the defending champion in the Spanish capital after he beat Stefanos Tsitsipas from Greece in the 2019 final while he finished runner-up to Rafael Nadal in Rome last year. He has now added a third clay-court tournament ahead of the French Open - the Monte-Carlo Masters - an event he won in 2013 and 2014. Djokovic exited the ATP Masters 1000 tournament in the quarter-final stage last year as he lost in three sets against Daniil Medvedev from Russia. In 2020 Monte-Carlo Masters runs from April 13-17 in the Principality.
