Süleyman Soylu said he took full responsibility for the curfew, which was implemented with the “good intention” of stemming the spread of coronavirus. The Turkish government said late on Friday that people living in 31 major cities would not be allowed to leave their homes for 48 hours from midnight. Shops were reportedly overwhelmed in the wake of the announcement, as people rushed to buy food and other essentials before the curfew came into effect. The abrupt announcement of the lockdown drew criticism, with many saying it heightened the risk of spreading coronavirus as people hurriedly descended on shops. “I acted in good faith to prevent the epidemic spreading,” Soylu, an ally of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, wrote on Twitter. “The scenes that occurred before the lockdown began, even for a short time, are my responsibility.” As of Sunday, Turkey has reported more than 52,000 cases of coronavirus, a number that is rising fast. --BBC--
