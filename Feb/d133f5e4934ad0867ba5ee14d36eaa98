Angola’s attorney general said last month that the country was considering asking Portuguese authorities to seize assets belonging to dos Santos, who is a suspect in a fraud investigation. The acquisition, Abanca’s fifth since 2014 and its second in Portugal, is conditional on the completion of due diligence, Abanca said in a statement. It did not disclose the price of the deal, while EuroBic could not immediately be reached for comment. 
 
Abanca Chairman Juan Carlos Escotet said last week his bank was mulling taking a controlling stake in the Portuguese lender. Like other European banks, Spanish lenders are under pressure due to low interest rates. Some are searching to boost revenues through foreign expansion.
