The five days of scheduled hearings will focus on allegations by her lawyers of abuses of process committed by Canadian and United States (US) authorities during her arrest in December two years ago at the Vancouver International Airport. Meng, 48, is facing charges in the US of bank fraud for allegedly misleading HSBC about Huawei’s business dealings in Iran, causing the bank to break US sanction laws. She has denied the charges and is fighting extradition from under house arrest in her Vancouver home, located in an upscale neighborhood of the Pacific coastal city. Meng’s lawyers have previously alleged that Canadian authorities improperly communicated with their US counterparts during her arrest, including sharing identifying details about her electronic devices. Canada has denied this and provided affidavits from members of the federal Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) who were involved in Meng’s arrest. On Monday prosecutors for the Canadian government questioned Winston Yep, an RCMP constable who was involved in Meng’s arrest, about how the decision was made to allow the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) to arrest Meng, instead of the RCMP.
