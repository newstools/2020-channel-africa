The President said he got the idea from a Ugandan citizen who "got a vision from God". "God had told him in a vision that I should organise national prayers, scientifically organised, for God to deliver us from Covid-19. I declare August 29, 2020, a day of national prayers and a public holiday. Stay in your houses or compounds and pray," Museveni said in a social media post. Uganda has so far recorded 2 679 coronavirus cases and 28 deaths. The government imposed strict restrictions in March after confirming the first case. --BBC--
