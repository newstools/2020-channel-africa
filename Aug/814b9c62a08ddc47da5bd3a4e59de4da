Led by a record plunge in self-employed workers, there were 220 000 less people employed in the second quarter, the Office for National Statistics said. Separate tax data for July 2020 showed that the number of staff on company payrolls had fallen by 730 000 since March 2020, sounding the alarm about a potentially much bigger rise in joblessness. Mounting job losses are expected as Britain winds down its job retention scheme which protects employees. It is due to close at the end of October 2020. “The cracks evident in the latest batch of labour market data are likely to soon turn into a chasm,” said Ruth Gregory, senior economist at Capital Economics. British finance minister Rishi Sunak said the figures showed the government’s support programmes were working but job losses were inevitable. “I’ve always been clear that we can’t protect every job, but we have a clear plan to protect, support and create jobs to ensure that nobody is left without hope,” he said. The unemployment rate unexpectedly held at 3.9% but that reflected an increase in people who had given up looking for work and who were therefore not considered to be unemployed, and people who said they were in work but were getting no pay. Economists polled by Reuters had expected the unemployment rate to rise to 4.2%. Last week the Bank of England forecast the jobless rate would hit 7.5% at the end in 2020. --Reuters--
