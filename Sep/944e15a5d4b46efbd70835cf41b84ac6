The national airline’s Spokesperson, Tlali Tlali, has reiterated that SAA requires R10.5 billion ($616.5 million). Government has said it is in the process of sourcing the funding. This comes as SAA says it is hoping that talks with SAA Technical, which is a separate entity within the stable, over payment of tens of millions of Rand owed will bear fruit and Mango Airlines, a subsidy of SAA, will not be grounded. SAA Technical has withdrawn its services to Mango due to non-payment. Mango says it remains committed to flying all passengers to their respective destinations as planned, especially over this weekend. Mango can confirm that ongoing key and sensitive discussions are taking place between Mango and South African Airways Technical currently to resolve any dispute. Mango is currently operating as normal. Customers should check Mango’s website for any changes to flight status. Tlali has confirmed that SAA owes SAA Technical tens of millions of Rand, but hopes the matter can be resolved. ($1 = R17.03) --SABC--
