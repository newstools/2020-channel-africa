There has been a public outcry from all sectors and employees belonging to Communications Workers’ Union (CWU) have embarked on a strike. Meanwhile, SABC management is expected this morning to meet with representatives of CWU and the Broadcasting, Electronic, Media and Allied Workers Union (Bemawu) to discuss the alternatives to retrenchments. The public broadcaster has requested to urgently meet with the unions in the hope of avoiding a threatened blackout scheduled to start this morning. 

The public broadcaster started the retrenchment of about 400 staff last week. Letters were issued to staff informing them that their positions are either redundant or that they are considered surplus and have to reapply for their jobs. The CWU is demanding among others that the current board be dissolved and for the SABC to be placed under administration. SABC human resources head, Dr Mojaki Mosia says: “The board has announced that they are putting the Section 189 on suspension for a period of seven days. That simply means we will wait as management for a directive from the board on what should be the next step. Management is working as per the resolution and the direction of the board.”
