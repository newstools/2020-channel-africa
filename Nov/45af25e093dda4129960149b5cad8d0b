This news comes just hours after Uganda’s President, Yoweri Museveni, proposed talks and then deleted the tweet that mentioned it. Ethiopia’s government has been very firm that it is not interested in talking to the TPLF. It argues that the party, which is in power in Tigray, has resisted a peaceful resolution of the differences with the federal government over the past two years. "Any mediation effort will incentivise impunity and unruliness," Ethiopia's State Minister of Foreign Affairs, Redwan Hussein, has told journalists in Addis Ababa. "Any country would not sit down with part of the country that boldly claims to have rockets and missiles and vows to attack." Obasanjo is “on his way to Addis Ababa for talks”, his Spokesperson, Kehinde Akinyemi, is quoted by the AFP news agency as saying. "He is going there for mediation," he added, but did not give any more details. --BBC--
