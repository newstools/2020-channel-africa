Aviation minister Hadi Sirika says the move is part of measures to contain the spread of coronavirus by reducing the number of people at the airports. He said only travellers will be allowed inside the airports. “Henceforth, all VIPs will no longer be permitted to bring non-travelling aides into the Airport Terminals. This especially applies to Governors, Ministers, NASS members, Judiciary and Military officers,” he said.

Domestic flights from airports in the main cities Abuja and Lagos are set to resume from July 8, with other airports following later.
