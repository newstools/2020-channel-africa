This follows president Ramaphosa’s call on larger businesses in particular to take care of their workers during this period and to marshal every resource and their every energy to fight this epidemic, the group said. “Supermarket employees are at the forefront of serving and safeguarding customers by implementing the group’s strict hygiene measures while distribution centre employees are key players in the retail supply chain to restock stores as quickly as possible,” it said. “Our employees are crucial players in the task ahead and the group wants to thank and reward them for their tireless efforts to stock our shelves with food and other essentials for our 29 million shoppers.” The ‘appreciation bonus’ will be paid to employees next Thursday, 2 April 2020. The group employs around 147 000 people across 2 800 outlets in 15 countries. “This is one of the many measures we have initiated to support our most vital teams including the supply of free hand sanitiser and expanded leave guidelines to cater for those impacted,” the group said. Shoprite urged South Africans to shop responsibly during the crisis, saying that it is well stocked and there is plenty of food and products, but restocking shelves takes time. “Current gaps on supermarket shelves will be filled as our warehouses remain well stocked and new stock is arriving regularly. We have also increased orders and are sourcing new and additional suppliers,” it said. “We are doing everything in our power to ensure our doors will remain open, our stores remain safe and our prices remain low.” --Reuters--
