Brent crude LCOc1 fell 10 cents, or 0.2%, to $42.04 a barrel by 0655 GMT, while United States (US) crude CLc1 was at $39.72 a barrel, down 11 cents, or 0.3%. Both contracts rose about 9% last week and Brent crude futures have flipped into backwardation, so that oil for immediate delivery costs more than that to be provided later, usually an indication of tightening supply. “The market has entered a slight backwardation up to October 2020. It times in with some of our estimates that by around November, the market could get really tight,” said Howie Lee, an economist at Singapore’s OCBC Bank. “I find it more difficult for oil to move higher at this point, especially with the growing concern about second-wave contagion.” In Canada and the United States, the number of operating oil and natural gas rigs fell to a record low last week, even as higher oil prices prompt some producers to start drilling again. The OPEC+ group, consisting of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, including Russia, has yet to decide whether to extend a record supply cut of 9.7 million barrels per day (bpd) for a fourth month in August. However, Iraq and Kazakhstan pledged to comply better with oil production cuts during an OPEC+ panel on Thursday. Oil prices have also been supported by a recovery in fuel demand globally following a collapse in April-May 2020 during virus shutdowns, as nations worldwide resume economic activity. Still, the World Health Organisation reported a record jump in global infections on Sunday, with the biggest increase seen in North and South America. --Reuters—
