The Tanzania Civil Aviation Authority (TCAA) nullified the approval granted to Fly 540, Air Kenya Express and Safarilink Aviation. The airlines operate daily flights to the tourist destinations of Kilimanjaro and Zanzibar. "The basis of the decision to nullify our approval for the three Kenyan airlines is the on-going dispute between the two countries," Tanzania Civil Aviation Authority Director General Hamza Johari is quoted as saying by the Citizen newspaper. Earlier, the national carrier Kenya Airways had been banned after Nairobi said passengers from Tanzania have to quarantine for 14 days when they arrive in the country. President John Magufuli declared Tanzania free of coronavirus in June. His government has been criticised for its relaxed approach to the disease. --BBC--
