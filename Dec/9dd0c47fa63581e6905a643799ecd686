It comes just days after authorities confirmed that a new, faster-spreading, coronavirus variant had been detected. Some hospitals and medical centres have reported a huge rise in admissions, putting a heavy strain on resources. President Cyril Ramaphosa is widely expected to announce tougher restrictions to prevent the virus from spreading further. The grim milestone was announced on Sunday by South Africa's Health Minister, Zweli Mkhize. The country has now confirmed 1 004 413 Covid-19 infections and 26 735 deaths since the outbreak began in March. Last week, South Africa recorded a daily average of 11 700 new infections - a rise of 39% from the previous week - and from Wednesday to Friday the daily number of new cases was above 14 000. The new coronavirus variant - known as 501.V2 - is believed to be driving the surge in infections. It was identified by a network of South African scientists in the Eastern Cape Province and then rapidly spread to other parts of the country. --BBC-- COVID-19 STATISTICS IN SOUTH AFRICA sabcnews.com |  SABC News Channel | SABC Radio news SOURCE: Department of Health  & ﻿National Institute of Communicable Diseases  CASES GAUTENG WESTERN CAPE KWAZULU-NATAL EASTERN CAPE FREE STATE LIMPOPO NORTH WEST MPUMALANGA NORTHERN CAPE 183653 166849 22705 34920 UNALLOCATED 0 AS AT 27 DECEMBER 2020 6925 543 638 DEATHS 2152 6218 5334 3971 577 CONFIRMED CASES| 1 004 413 DEATHS | 26 735 TESTS CONDUCTED | 6 445 318 RECOVERIES | 844 874 377 86163 274272 38540 24870 196833  Free State  North West  Gauteng  Mpumalanga  Northern Cape Eastern Cape  Limpopo  KwaZulu-Natal Western Cape 61771
