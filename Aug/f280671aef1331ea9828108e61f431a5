The Millennium Hall's medical Director Dr Wuletaw Chanie told the BBC the facilityâ€™s intensive care unit (ICU) had reached its capacity while the semi-ICU is also almost full. Dr Chanie said the hall, a concert venue which has been transformed into a centre for treating coronavirus patients, would probably exceed its admission capacity within a week and could no longer accommodate new patients who need intensive care and high-flow oxygen. The centre receives around 20 patients per day and is currently treating more than 200. More than half are receiving supplementary oxygen. Ethiopia has seen a significant increase in Covid-19 cases recently, with around 25,000 cases in August alone. According to the Ministry of Health, Ethiopia has reported more than 42,000 coronavirus cases, with most cases in the capital Addis Ababa. --BBC--
