Elections to renew the central African country's legislature and local councils are taking place for the first time in seven years, after two postponements. Despite the delays, the campaigning has been low key. In the capital, Yaounde, the few banners put up by the ruling Cameroon People's Democratic Movement (RDPC in its French initials) are barely more numerous than posters calling on people to pick up their litter. The RDPC supports President, Paul Biya, one of the world's oldest and longest-serving leaders, who has ruled with a steely fist for 37 of his 86 years. The main opposition party, the Movement for the Rebirth of Cameroon (MRC) is refusing to field a single candidate. Its Leader, Maurice Kamto, spent nine months in jail after his defeat in the 2018 presidential elections and is now abroad. "We could have had a few seats in parliament and some town councillors, but how would that enable us to influence events in Cameroon?" Kamto said in an interview with AFP in Paris last month. "I would have voted for the MRC but on Sunday I'm going to stay at home," a young Yaounde voter, who gave his name as Xavier, told AFP. The boycott will all but guarantee a crushing victory for the RDPC, which in the outgoing legislature had 148 out of 180 seats. "Where's the opposition?" was the whimsical question aired by a local RDPC Chief, Augustin Tsafack, on the sidelines of a party rally in Yaounde. The other large opposition party, the Social Democratic Front (SDF), which currently has 18 seats, will take part in Sunday's vote, going back on a threat to snub it. In parallel with the leaden political mood, Cameroon is struggling with two conflicts. In two English-speaking regions in the west, the armed forces are battling separatists who want to secede from the majority French-speaking country. The 28-month conflict has claimed more than 3 000 lives and caused more than 700 000 people to flee, according to tolls compiled by NGOs.
