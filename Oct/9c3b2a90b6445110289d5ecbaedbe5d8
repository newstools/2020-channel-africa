The Nyarugenge Intermediate Court in the capital Kigali said Rusesabagina should be remanded on grounds that he is a flight risk. The former hotelier, 67, will remain in detention for 30 days pending his trial on 13 charges related to terrorism, financing terrorism, kidnap, arson, and recruiting child soldiers. “Rusesabagina claims to be a Belgian and not a Rwandan citizen, which is reason enough to believe that he is a flight risk,” Judge Adolphe Udahemuka said in a verdict. “His claim to get bail on the basis of needing medical attention is baseless since, by his own admission, he has access to all the medical attention he needs while in detention. The court, therefore, finds that all his reasons are baseless. He will remain in custody until his trial begins,” Udahemuka ruled. He cannot appeal the decision since the court is the highest for appealing pre-trial detention. Last week, Rusesabagina admitted to being part of an opposition group that formed an armed rebel wing that claimed a spate of attacks in Rwanda which left civilians dead. He, however, denied responsibility for the attacks Force de Liberation Nationale conducted against Rwanda, noting that his personal work was to pursue diplomacy. --TheEastAfrican--
