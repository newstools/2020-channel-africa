Anban Pillay, from the Department of Health, told the website that the payment for Covax was delayed. South Africa has recorded the highest number of coronavirus cases on the continent. Finance Minister Tito Mboweni had set aside $33 million for vaccines, AFP news agency reports, but it appears that the treasury has not yet released the funds. The money that South Africa can raise should be enough to vaccinate about 10% of the countryâ€™s population, AFP quotes Mboweni as saying. It will need help from Covax to boost that number. --BBC--
