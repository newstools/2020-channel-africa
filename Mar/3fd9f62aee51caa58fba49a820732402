President Donald Trump said the US economy might take a hit from the coronavirus outbreak but he predicted the challenge would eventually pass and defended his handling of the crisis. The spreading coronavirus has led to a steep downturn in the stock market. Trump said he would ask Congress for a payroll tax cut and other “very major” stimulus moves to ease the economic pain, but details were unclear. Japan unveiled a second package of measures worth about $4 billion in spending, focusing on support to small and mid-sized firms. Wall Street jumped more than 3% at the open but pared gains to about 1% in choppy trade. Investors hoped the sell-off on Monday marked the low of a downturn that has pushed the major US indexes close to bear market territory, a decline of 20% from recent peaks. “Investors are trying put a bottom in here,” said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments in New Vernon, New Jersey. “It seems like that yesterday was such a collection of so much bad news, it shocked the market down. Today with fresh eyes people are picking out the names they think have dropped the most,” he said.
