It had to be unambiguous, curt and to the point. Instead, the much-publicised suspension has become so ponderous and meandering that it's hard to keep track of what the "precautionary paid suspension" was about. A damning seven months have passed, at the cost of two expensive CEO salaries (Moroe's and stand-in Jacques Faul's). It's allowed conspiracy theories, accusations and counter-accusations to take centre stage. Meanwhile, the saga has dragged the organisation’s name through the dirt. CSA has shielded themselves behind an external forensic audit report that has yet to arrive four months after it was signed off for commission in March 2020. The terms of reference of the investigation, according to a Sunday Times report, have also now been altered fundamentally to exclude the board's role in the decisions that led to cricket's summer of sombre. CSA have vehemently denied this. In a Wednesday night statement, President Chris Nenzani said they felt obliged to respond to the report. "The CSA board has not changed the terms of reference of this investigation," CSA wrote. "In fact, the Members’ Council commissioned the forensic investigation and this has been formally communicated. It follows that the board cannot make changes to the terms of reference because it does not have the authority to do so." Moroe was suspended on December 6, the same day Standard Bank announced that they were severing their ties with cricket after more than a decade.
