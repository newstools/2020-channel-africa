Locals in Moyale town in Kenya, say heavily armed Ethiopian soldiers crossed the border into Kenya, ransacked neighbourhoods before arresting the youths. The soldiers accused the 10 of sheltering members of the OLF Shane group, which has been blamed for a series of attacks and killings in Western and Southern Ethiopia. Residents allege Kenyan security officers looked on, as the young men were dragged away across the border. Neither the Kenyan nor the Ethiopian government have made any comments on this alleged incursion into Kenyan territory. The Ethiopian military is currently conducting an operation against members of the group in Southern and Western Ethiopia. Heavy fighting has been heard in areas bordering Kenya over the last few weeks. Early this month, armed men from the OLF Shane group killed 60 people and torched more than 20 houses in a raid in western Ethiopia. The OLF Shane split from the Oromo Liberation Front (OLF), a once exiled opposition group, that was allowed back to Ethiopia after Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed took power in 2018.Â
