The Egyptian Initiative for Human Rights says that its director of criminal justice Karim Ennarah has been arrested while on holiday in the Red Sea resort of Dahab. The group says he's been taken to an undisclosed location by National Security officers. On Sunday, EIPR says that its office manager, Mohammed Basheer, was arrested on charges including joining a terror group and spreading false news. Rights groups estimate that there are some 60,000 political prisoners in Egypt. --bbc-
