The traders have lit bonfires and police are on the ground dispersing them. Local media reports say the traders do not want the country to on lockdown as their income will be affected. On Thursday, vendors in Mzuzu city were also protesting against the looming lockdown. The vendors say they will be unable to provide for their families during the 21 days. Several African countries - including Uganda and South Africa - have imposed lockdowns with some providing food for the vulnerable.
