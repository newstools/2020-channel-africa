The third sales cycle was scheduled to take place from March 30 to April 3. The pandemic has placed new worries on the diamond industry, which faced slowing demand last year due to trade tensions and protests in Hong Kong. The worldâ€™s largest producer of rough diamonds by carats, Alrosa, this month had said it was considering options for online trade as global travel restrictions complicate traditional physical inspection of gemstones. As the third rough diamond sales cycle called Sights is canceled - an event where customers can inspect and buy diamonds from De Beers has been canceled, the group will seek innovative ways to meet the supply in the coming weeks, Anglo said. De Beers Group is enabling Sightholders to defer 100% of their Sight 3 allocations to later in the year, Anglo added. Sights are held 10 times a year in Botswana, Namibia and South Africa. --REUTERS--
