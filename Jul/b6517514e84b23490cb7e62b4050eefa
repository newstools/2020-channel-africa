Safa's communications Manager Dominic Chimhavi emphasised the timing of the release was purely coincidental and that they had been working on the statement for a "few days". "We had already been working on the statement and it just happened that we released it at the same time the outcry over the tweets was gaining momentum," he explained. Chimhavi added that the association has been trying to discuss the tweets with Fish, who was part of Bafana's technical team at the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations. "We wish to engage with Mark so that we can find out what triggered his tweets that have evoked such an angry response from South Africans," Chimhavi added. "We will continue trying to reach out to him." The controversy erupted after Fish 'liked' a post on the social media platform Twitter that was critical of the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement.
