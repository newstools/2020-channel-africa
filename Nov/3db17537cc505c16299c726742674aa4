He told the BBC's Newsday programme that the arrest of opposition candidates does not seem to be related to Covid-19 guidelines. Opiyo said the ruling party had drawn huge crowds during ongoing campaigns and none of its candidates had been arrested. "We don't think this is about Covid guidelines, we think this is about politics and the election because government candidates have also been shown with large crowds and yet been escorted peacefully by police," he said. Opiyo said candidates cannot control the crowds that turn out in their rallies and criticised the police for using violence against opposition supporters. "Police officers who we know, who we have documented shooting and killing innocent civilians, unarmed civilians, must be held to account and be prosecuted if government is to show its commitment to a peaceful and lawful electoral process," he said. --BBC--
