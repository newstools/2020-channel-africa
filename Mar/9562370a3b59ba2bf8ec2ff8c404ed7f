The organisation has also asked companies and governments to increase production by 40% as the death toll from the respiratory illness mounted. Meanwhile, the United States (US) Federal Reserve cut interest rates on Tuesday in an emergency move to try to prevent a global recession and the World Bank announced $12 billion to help countries fight the coronavirus, which has taken a heavy toll on air travel, tourism and other industries, threatening global economic growth prospects. The virus continued to spread in South Korea, Japan, Europe, Iran and the US and several countries reported their first confirmed cases, taking the total to some 80 nations hit with the flu-like illness that can lead to pneumonia. In Iran, doctors and nurses lack supplies and 77 people have died, one of the highest numbers outside China. The United Arab Emirates announced it was closing all schools for four weeks. The death toll in Italy, Europe’s hardest-hit country, jumped to 79 on Tuesday and Italian officials are considering expanding the area under quarantine. France reported its fourth coronavirus death, while Indonesia, Ukraine, Argentina and Chile reported their first coronavirus cases. About 3.4% of confirmed cases of COVID-19 have died, far above seasonal flu’s fatality rate of under 1%, but the virus can be contained, WHO Chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said in Geneva on Tuesday. “To summarise, COVID-19 spreads less efficiently than flu, transmission does not appear to be driven by people who are not sick, it causes more severe illness than flu, there are not yet any vaccines or therapeutics, and it can be contained.” Health officials have said the death rate is 2% to 4% depending on the country and may be much lower if there are thousands of unreported mild cases of the disease. Since the coronavirus outbreak, prices of surgical masks have increased sixfold, N95 respirators have tripled in cost and protective gowns cost twice as much, the WHO said. It estimates healthcare workers each month will need 89 million masks, 76 million gloves and 1.6 million pairs of goggles. The coronavirus, which emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late 2019, has spread around the world, with more new cases now appearing outside China than inside. There are almost 91 000 cases globally of which more than 80 000 are in China. China’s death toll was 2 946, with more than 166 fatalities elsewhere. --Reuters--
