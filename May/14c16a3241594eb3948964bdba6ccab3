A total of 1.287 of S&P’s ratings are now on a downgrade warning, either with ‘negative outlooks’ where a move might take two years, or on ‘CreditWatch with negative implications’ where the risk is almost immediate. It tops 1.028 in the wake of the financial crisis in 2009 and comes despite nearly 700 downgrades already being impacted by COVID-19 in recent months. 

“Almost two-thirds of issuers face downgrade potential due to the unprecedented challenges posed by COVID-related containment measures,” S&P said in its analysis. Media and leisure firms, carmakers and transportation companies have the highest proportion of at-risk ratings, the data also showed. Hotels and entertainment firms have the highest percentage of CreditWatch negatives as a share of total potential downgrades, with 74% compared to 35% for other companies in media and entertainment, 49% in automotive, and 43% in transportation. --Reuters--
