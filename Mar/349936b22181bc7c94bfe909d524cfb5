Like many living in areas where opportunities are scarce, he knew he had to move. When he turned 12 he travelled south to Nigeria's commercial megacity, Lagos. "I came to Lagos to look for money," Abdullahi, now 40, told AFP. As with many of the arrivals from the north, he has made his living driving a motorbike taxi locally known as an okada. Yet a recent ban on okadas across major parts of Lagos has left drivers struggling to feed their families. Rising migration to Lagos has caused the city's population to soar spurred by widening inequality between the largely-Muslim north and Christian-majority south. According to the World Bank, 87 million people in Africa's most populous country live in extreme poverty -- of which 87 per cent live in northern Nigeria. The nation's total population is around 190 million people. "Regionally, the north lags far behind the south in every human capital outcome," a 2019 World Bank report said. A jihadist insurgency in the northeast, armed attacks and kidnappings in the northwest, and the impact of climate change have caused conditions in northern Nigeria to worsen. Authorities in Lagos said the ban on motorbike taxis and rickshaws was aimed at cutting down on "deaths and disorderliness" on the city's choked roads. But many drivers like Abdullahi suspect it was aimed primarily at the large number of northerners who have headed south in search of a better life. The effect has been increased migration to cities such as Lagos, Nigeria's capital Abuja and the southern oil-hub Port Harcourt, where jobs are easier to come by. Recent data is not available, but a 2010 study from Nigeria's National Population Commission estimated 23 % of the population were "migrants" and 40 % of those living in Lagos came from other regions. --TheEastAfrican--
