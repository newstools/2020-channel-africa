The two Wicket record partnerships for New Zealand in international T20 history between Sophie Devine and Suzie Bates was the catalyst in their sideâ€™s win. Devine was in impeccable form yet again as she top scored with 105 to power the Ferns to a series win as she smashed 3 sixes and 12 fours in a 65-ball innings as the hosts posted a mammoth total of 171/2 and her highest individual innings in T20 internationals. The Proteas in response got nowhere close, all out for 102 after 17 overs with Lizelle Lee the only notable performer with 25 (22) and Anna Peterson taking 3/22 as the series was comfortably one by New Zealand. After winning the toss, Dane van Niekerk opted to bowl first and that proved to be the call the hosts were after as they ran riot with the bat from the onset. Shabnim Ismail (1/21) momentarily slowed down the rate as she clean-bowled Lauren Down for 11 (9) in the third over to leave the hosts 27/1. That wicket proved to be the start for the scene of carnage as Devine and Bates cleared the boundary with ease to leave the Proteas bowlers with no idea of what had just hit them. The pair who has been instrumental in their sides display in the T20I series continued their impressive batting exhibition and helped overhaul their previous best partnership with the two Wicket record partnerships of 142 which proved to be the bedrock of the highest total in this series. The Proteas just failed to fire in their chase of the 172 target and were no match for the hosts who proved to be the better side on the day.
