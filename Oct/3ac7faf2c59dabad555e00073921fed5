Documents are reportedly being taken from the premises as well as red military-style berets and overalls. Uganda police spokesperson, Fred Enanga, told the BBC: "We are carrying out operations on misuse of some of the uniforms and accoutrements that are gazetted". In September last year, the government designated the red beret worn by Bobi Wine and his supporters as military uniform â€“ meaning anyone deemed to be possessing or wearing them illegally could be prosecuted. Enanga said the operation was ongoing and that officers would search other premises as well as the offices of the National Unity Platform party. Bobi Wine has said state operatives are targeting him and his party as they prepare to challenge President Yoweri Museveni in the general election in early 2021. But the police spokesperson insists the operation is not politically motivated. --BBC--
