The German automaker’s return to the black comes amid spiking coronavirus cases in Europe that led governments in France and Germany to order their countries back into strict national lockdowns on Wednesday. “The coronavirus remains a central problem,” Volkswagen Chief Financial Officer Frank Witter said in a conference call with reporters. “This situation now is anything but relaxed.” But Witter said the group expected the economic recovery to continue and did “not anticipate any nationwide lockdowns in larger markets.” Witter said the takeover of United States truck maker Navistar International Corp by Volkswagen’s trucking unit Traton SE was an important acquisition, but the “current economic climate will not make this easy.” Volkswagen reiterated it expects to post a profit for the full year, saying its business “recovered noticeably” in the third quarter as sales in China of premium vehicles, including Audi and Porsche sports cars, rose 3%. The quarterly performance was also aided by a series of cost-cutting measures launched earlier in 2020.
