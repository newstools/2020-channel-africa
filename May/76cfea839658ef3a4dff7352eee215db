President Yoweri Museveni said only 30 lawyers under the Uganda Law Society will be added onto the list of essential service providers, the Daily Monitor newspaper reports. The president also imposed mandatory wearing of face masks in public as a control measure against Covid-19. Ugandans can wear washable, reusable cloth masks that are manufactured locally, he said in a televised address on Monday evening. Warehouses, wholesale shops, garages, insurance firms are allowed to reopen. All other lockdown measures, including closure of international borders, a ban on public and private transport, a ban on gatherings and a dusk-to-dawn curfew remain in place for another 14 days. Uganda has confirmed a total of 97 Covid-19 cases. --bbc--
