Ethiopia's Prime Minister, Abiy Ahmed, tweeted that water ministers from the three countries will attempt to reach what he called a win-win solution. The dam is close to Ethiopia's border with Sudan. Egypt, which relies on the Nile for 90% of its fresh water, views itâ€™s as an existential threat. In March, Ethiopia pulled out of US-mediated talks, accusing the US of overstepping the role of neutral observer by saying that the dam should not be completed without an agreement. Construction of the dam began in 2011. --BBC--
