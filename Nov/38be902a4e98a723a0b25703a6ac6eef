Lionel Messi scored from the penalty spot inside five minutes and Gerard Pique headed home to secure an unconvincing victory. Messi is yet to score a goal from open play this season.

They fielded a significantly depleted side, with only 13 first-team players travelling to Spain along with a further six youth players. Six players had tested positive for coronavirus at the Ukrainian club before the game. --BBC--
