All-rounder Moeen, 33, has not played a Test since taking a break from cricket in 2019, while keeper-batsman Bairstow, 31, was dropped a year ago. Uncapped Essex batsman, Dan Lawrence, is included, with Rory Burns absent as his wife is expecting their first child. England play two Tests, both in Galle, starting on January 14 and 22. The tour was due to take place in March this year but was cut short because of the coronavirus pandemic. Wicketkeeper, Ben Foakes, who has not played a Test for almost two years, also features in a 16-man squad that includes three spinners in Moeen, Dom Bess and Jack Leach. Stokes and Archer will return for the four-Test series in India starting in February.  England squad: Joe Root (capt), Moeen Ali, James Anderson, Jonny Bairstow (wk), Dom Bess, Stuart Broad, Jos Buttler (wk), Zak Crawley, Sam Curran, Ben Foakes (wk), Dan Lawrence, Jack Leach, Dom Sibley, Olly Stone, Chris Woakes, Mark Wood. Reserves: James Bracey (wk), Mason Crane, Saqib Mahmood, Craig Overton, Matthew Parkinson, Ollie Robinson, Amar Virdi. --BBC--
