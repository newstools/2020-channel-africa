The boys arrived in the state capital Katsina by bus. Reporters said they looked tired and weary but otherwise well. Some were still wearing their school uniforms, while others clutched grey blankets. The December 11 attack on the school in Kankara town was claimed by the Islamist militant group Boko Haram. It remains unclear if all those captured have now been released. Katsina Governor Aminu Bello Masari said on Thursday that 344 children had been turned over to security officials. "I think we can say, we have recovered most of the boys, if not all of them," he told the Associated Press. --BBC--
