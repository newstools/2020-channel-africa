African Chamber of Commerce and Industry fell to 89.9% from 92.7% in the previous month, the business group said on Wednesday. That’s the lowest number since August, when weak economic growth and rising unemployment provoked a wave of xenophobic violence and prompted warnings from business groups and analysts that the country may be forced to seek assistance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The economy has since slumped into a recession and could contract as much as 4% this year as a 21-day nationwide lockdown aimed at slowing the spread of the pandemic weighs on output, according to the Reserve Bank. Moody’s Investors Service cut the country’s debt to junk on March 27 and Fitch Ratings lowered its assessment deeper into sub-investment grade a week later. The latest business confidence number therefore does not yet fully reveal the extent of Covid-19 on the economy and the business climate, the South African Chamber of Commerce and Industry said. It “mainly contains the effect of the subdued performance of the domestic economy and to some measure the effect on international trade owing to the impact of the virus on trading partners”. While Finance Minister Tito Mboweni has said the government could consider approaching the IMF for assistance to fight the pandemic, senior officials in the ruling African National Congress and its alliance partners rejected that, saying it could undermine the nation’s sovereignty. --IOL--
