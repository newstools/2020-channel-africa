The 30-year-old striker has been linked with a move away from the Premier League giants, Aubameyang’s contract runs out at the end of the 2020-21 season and he has yet to agree an extension at the Emirates Stadium. “I don’t think he will sign a new deal. I think he’ll leave with a heavy heart”, Keown told TalkSport. “I think he’s the nearest thing I have seen to Thierry Henry at the football club and the club will have to make swift decisions. They can’t allow what happened a few years ago with the transfers just going on and on. The club needs direction.” The former England international added: “It’s a real concern for Arsenal, recently with Mesut Ozil, they lost Aaron Ramsey, they lost Alexis Sanchez. “I think the message needs to be to the player ‘look, we can’t have you captaining the club if there’s uncertainty around your contract’, in the last year of his contract, that can’t be allowed to happen. “Whether you keep him, whether you don’t, that all depends on the monetary side. 

“So if they’re only going to get an offer of $25-30 million then you have to consider whether you’re going to keep him there or not and whether the player has got the mental capacity to stay, but he can’t be captain because the message is the wrong one to the rest of the group.”
