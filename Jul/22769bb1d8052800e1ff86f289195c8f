The Whites ended their 16-year exodus from the Premier League earlier this week. Their return to the top flight has prompted a frenzy of speculation regarding potential signings. And a pair of superstar centre-forwards have emerged as particularly eye-catching prospects. One area Leeds may wish to strengthen in, however, is attacking midfield. Pablo Hernandez has shone this campaign, but at 35 years of age, has often had to settle for playing less than 90 minutes per match. One potential option is Argentine superstar-in-the-making Thiago Almada. The 19-year-old - previously linked with Man Utd - has already become a regular with Velez Sarsfield in Argentina. He has provided nine goals and four assists inside his first 46 professional club appearances along the way. Bielsa has a link to the club, having managed them to the Argentine Clausura in 1997-98. Now, Transfermarkt report that an 'offer is understood to be in the making' for the blossoming youngster. Almada has also responded to the rumours directly, revealing his desire to be coached by El Loco. Speaking to TyC sports (via HITC), Almada said when quizzed on the links: "I would like Bielsa to coach me. "My friends sent me that something about Bielsa, but I am calm. Whether it happens or not, we have to see. Almada further heightened speculation when highlighting the similarities between the styles of play of Velez and Leeds. "I don't watch much soccer, but I saw some Leeds highlights and I saw something similar to what we did in VÃ©lez with (Gabriel) Heinze." --News24--
