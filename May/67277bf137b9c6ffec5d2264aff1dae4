The public broadcaster says the hike was part of a three-year wage agreement that was signed in 2018. That wage deal expires in 2020. The SABC says it will meet with unions soon to discuss a new business model. The public broadcaster says the 6% increment was also well below the one stipulated by National Treasury. Board Chairperson, Bongumusa Makhathini, says their employees deserve an increase as they helped to turn around the public broadcaster. “In 2018 April a Board approved a three-year agreement with the unions and that three-year agreement spoke to an increase of 5% in 2018, 6% 2019 and 6% in 2020. 

"There is no effort on our side to reverse that and that agreement still stands. Our employees have done exceptionally well to turn around the SABC and we have honoured that agreement.” The SABC’s response follow reports over concerns that the public broadcaster might have to turn to government for further bailout in the coming months.
