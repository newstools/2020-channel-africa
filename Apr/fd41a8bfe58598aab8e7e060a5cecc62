Ratings agency Fitch had already said on Thursday that the lender, Land Bank, had defaulted on debt and that risks posed by state-owned enterprises had been a factor in its decision to lower South Africa’s credit rating this month to BB, from BB+. Land Bank is one of several state-owned firms that are facing financial difficulties and piling pressure on President Cyril Ramaphosa’s cash-strapped government as it scrambles to revive a recession hit-economy. The bank, which funds commercial and emerging farmers, said on Monday that it was experiencing a liquidity shortfall and was in talks with various stakeholders to address its financial obligations. The lender warned investors that it was at risk of defaulting on its $1 billion Domestic Medium Term Note (DMTN) Programme dated October 18, 2010, and its $2 billion DMTN Programme dated March 13, 2017. “Those defaults have subsequently occurred,” the lender said in a statement dated April 23, but issued on Friday. --Reuters--
