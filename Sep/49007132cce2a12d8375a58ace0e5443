The four-day meeting, the first to be held virtually owing to the global Covid-19 pandemic, runs up to Friday in Kigali, Rwanda. The summit themed ‘Feed the Cities, Grow the Continent, Leveraging Urban Food Markets to Achieve Sustainable Food Systems in Africa’ is expected to attract 2000 delegates. The extravaganza comes amid increased criticism of consistent lack of transparency and accountability from an initiative that has received about $1 billion in funding for the last 16 years. Billed as the sure-fire answer to food insecurity in Africa, the initiative was mooted through a partnership between the Gates Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation to jump start a comprehensive agricultural transformation on the continent. The US, UK and German governments are the other financiers of AGRA. AGRA’s goal was to double yields and incomes and improve food security for at least 30 million farming households in Africa by 2021. Subsidised synthetic fertiliser and affordable hybrid seeds were the driving force. The summit comes up on the backdrop of ‘False Promises: The Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA)’ which found “very little evidence that AGRA is benefiting 30 million smallholder households, and that it is likely benefiting large-scale commercial farmers, mostly men, rather than smallholder women farmers.” The study was undertaken by a coalition of German and African civil society organisations backed by research from Tufts University in the US. 

The data portrays what the researchers described as weak yield increases of just 18 %  over 12 years and a disturbing evidence of worsening food insecurity situation across AGRA countries, with a 31 % increase in the number of undernourished people in AGRA's 13 target countries since 2006, the year of inception of the initiative. --TheEastAfrican--
