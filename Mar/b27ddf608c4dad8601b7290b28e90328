Those classed as key workers, such as medics, supermarket employees and journalists, are allowed to leave their homes. During my eight kilometres commute from home to the office in the capital, Kigali, you go through about five police checkpoints. On Monday, police shot dead two young men on the outskirts of the city who they said had defied the lockdown. Police said they had tried to put up a fight with officers. There have been reports of casual labourers, who now have no income are trying escape Kigali to join their families in villages, walking long distances as public transport has been banned.
