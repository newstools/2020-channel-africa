Consumer groups’ umbrella organization VZBV and the company came to a comprehensive agreement, the court said, without elaborating.

The parties will announce details at 1300 local time (1200 GMT), the court added. VW admitted using illegal software to cheat United States (US) diesel engine tests in 2015, a scandal which has cost it more than $30 billion in vehicle refits, fines and provisions.  

Nearly all US owners of affected cars agreed to take part in a $25 billion settlement in 2016 in the United States, but VW has said there was no legal basis for consumers in Germany to seek compensation due to differences in law. An initial attempt to reach an $900 million settlement with VZBV failed in February.
