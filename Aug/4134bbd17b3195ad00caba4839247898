Research suggests that abuse is widespread in Egypt, but it's believed that women often fear that if they file complaints they themselves will be blamed. The new law was proposed in July following a rare social media campaign in which a male student was accused of raping or harassing multiple women. He was later arrested. The case inspired many more women to come forward and share experiences of violence and abuse they'd endured. --BBC--
