The ruling Zanu PF has been calling for the removal of targeted sanctions imposed by the west over alleged human rights abuses and election rigging. MDC spokesperson Fadzayi Mahere was speaking to the SABC. “Sanctions are just a propaganda tool that’s being used by this regime to excuse the bad governance and corruption crisis that we see in Zim. If you look at how this government has conducted itself, if you look at the human rights abuses, if you look at the abductions, if you look at all the corruption scandal, you will see that it’s not sanctions that are responsible for Zimbabwe’s crisis. It’s bad governance that is at the root of Zimbabwe’s suffering.” The African Union Bureau of Heads of States and Governments called for the immediate lifting of economic sanctions on Zimbabwe. The bureau held a teleconference led by President Cyril Ramaphosa in his capacity as AU Chairperson in April. --Reuters--
