The explosion at a checkpoint near Somalia's parliament left several vehicles on fire. The Islamist militant group, al-Shabab, said it carried out the attack. It has stepped up its campaign of violence in East Africa. Ten days ago, the group killed about 90 people in another bomb blast in Mogadishu. Over the weekend its fighters attacked a military base on the Kenyan coast, killing three American personnel and destroying several aircraft. In response Somali officials say al-Shabab positions have been hit in air strikes. --BBC--
