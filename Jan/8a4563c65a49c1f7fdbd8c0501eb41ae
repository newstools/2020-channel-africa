Blaise Pascal Kararumiye was arrested on Thursday, his employer, Radio Isanganiro, told the BBC. The authorities have not disclosed the charges against the journalist and he was interrogated without a lawyer, Station Director, Sylvere Ntakarutimana, added. Radio is the main source of information for many Burundians. Most privately-owned stations were shut after a 2015 coup attempt and have stayed closed, says Reporters Without Borders. Some journalists have fled the country. In October 2019, four journalists of the privately-owned newspaper Iwacu were arrested while interviewing residents in the north-western Bubanza province following an attack by a rebel group. They remain in police custody. --BBC--
