Floodwaters destroyed several properties and makeshift structures on major roads. Poor drainage and buildings erected on waterways mean many parts of the city are prone to flooding whenever it rains. Ghanaian soldiers and staff from the National Disaster Management Organisation have been rescuing residents marooned by floodwaters. Local media report that water levels rose to 4.5 metres in some parts. --BBC--
