According to Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Trade and Industry, Michel Sebera, Rwanda has been chairing the EAC negotiations with the UK, and more talks are scheduled in the coming weeks. Kigali is, however, also pursuing a bilateral post-Brexit trade deal with the UK that aims to replicate the European Union’s “Everything but Arms" scheme that will offer Rwandan exports duty and quota-free access to the British market from January 2021. Without a bilateral trade agreement, Rwanda and the UK currently trade under the “Most Favoured Nation” clause of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) that enforces equal treatment in providing trade concessions, privileges and immunities among its member countries. UK officials noted that Rwanda will continue to benefit under the WTO arrangement, even if a deal with the East African Community stalls. “Rwanda will continue to receive duty-free and quota-free trade access to UK markets for all products except arms and ammunition, to support trade between our countries,” said a UK government spokesperson. The UK has openly declared that it prefers to pursue a collective deal with the EAC. --TheEastAfrican--
