Recalled spinners Adil Rashid (3-51) and Moeen Ali (1-42) helped restrict the Proteas to 256-7 despite Quinton de Kock and David Miller both hitting 69. Jason Roy (21) and Jonny Bairstow (43) got England off to a fast start before the tourists stuttered. Joe Root (49) and Joe Denly (66) played maturely to stabilise the chase. But South Africa fought back with four quick wickets in a tense finale before Moeen and Chris Jordan guided England to 257-8 with 40 balls to spare. While the chase should never have been so tight, it was an improved performance from the world champions after they were beaten by seven wickets in the first ODI, with the second match abandoned because of rain. England will next face South Africa in three Twenty20 internationals, with the first match in East London on Wednesday. --BBC--
