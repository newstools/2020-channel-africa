The PSL are eager to get the 2019/20 season back underway in order to find out who will lift the trophy and which teams will be promoted and relegated. Meanwhile, SAFA have firmly stated that there will be no football unless the government gives the go-ahead following the lockdown regulations that were given to South Africa to help curb the coronavirus. Mthethwa has warned that the best way forward is for both governing bodies to be on the same page when it comes to solutions, in case playing football during lockdown becomes a possibility. "We want to engage their wise counsel on their thoughts on the re-opening of the lockdown with our own risk-adjusted strategy, as government," said Mthethwa as quoted by EWN. "They must counsel me, both of them [SAFA boss Danny Jordaan and PSL Chief Irvin Khoza], and I emphasise, it would be advisable that, as government, we get one voice from them. "My final message to both is, they are occupying an important space in society in regard to football, so as the Minister of Sports, Arts, and Culture, I would nudge them to work together at all material times in regard to football." --news24â€”
