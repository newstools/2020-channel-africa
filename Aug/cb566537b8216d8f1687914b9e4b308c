France says they will do everything they can to support the families of the victims and to respond to the attack that cost the lives of their citizens and two Nigeriens

"These six young people, who were members of the Non-Governmental Organisation ‘ACTED’, showed extraordinary commitment to the local population,” Macron tweeted. “I have decided to step up security measures for our citizens in the region. We will continue in our action to eradicate the terrorist groups, with the increased support of our partners.” Soldiers from France and Niger combed a giraffe reserve and surrounding areas on Monday for signs of the gunmen who killed six French aid workers along with their local guide and driver, a French military source said. Attackers on motorbikes ambushed the group on Sunday while driving through the reserve, a popular destination for expatriates 65 kilometres from Niger’s capital Niamey in an area considered safe by the government. Former colonial power France and other countries have warned people against travelling to parts of Niger where militants including Boko Haram and an affiliate of Islamic State operate in rural areas much further from the capital than the reserve. --Reuters--
