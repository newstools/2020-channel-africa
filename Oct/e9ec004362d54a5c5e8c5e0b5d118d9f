England, who have not played since the tournament was interrupted in March, won the title on Sunday after France failed to beat Scotland. Centre Emily Scarratt will lead the side in the absence of Hunter. Flanker Marlie Packer is in the match day 23 after nine months out. England head coach Simon Middleton said he was "disappointed" by the absence of Hunter but explained he wanted her to "recover properly" with "a big year ahead", referencing the World Cup that takes place in 11 months' time. Packer did not feature in any of England's Six Nations matches earlier this year because of an ankle injury and is joined in the pack by the returning Abbie Ward. Ward - known as Abbie Scott until her wedding in August - also missed the first four games of the Six Nations, having spent 11 months sidelined with an injury until earlier this month. "Having Abbie Ward and Marlie Packer back is a huge plus for us," Middleton said. "They're vitally experienced and talented players."
