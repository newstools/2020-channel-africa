The government has set strict rules that must be followed by mosques and worshippers, saying even a slight breach of the guidelines could lead to closure of mosques. Under the agreement with religious leaders, people above the age of 50, children and those with flu symptoms will not be allowed to enter mosques. All carpets have to be removed and the floor is to be regularly mopped with disinfectants. Worshippers are required to maintain a distance when praying, should wear face masks and avoid shaking hands or embracing others.Â
