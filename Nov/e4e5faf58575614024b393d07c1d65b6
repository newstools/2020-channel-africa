“When we say there is an outbreak it means there are cases. But at the moment I cannot say how many cases or how many have died and who died,” John Rumunu, Director-General for Preventive Health Services, told the BBC in the capital, Juba. He said the ministry and its partners were planning to conduct reactive measles vaccinations in the areas where the outbreaks have been reported. Medical charity Médecins Sans Frontiers (MSF) had last week said that 30 children with severe measles were being treated at its facility in Pibor area in eastern South Sudan. It called for an urgent vaccination campaign to stop the spread of the contagious disease. --BBC--
