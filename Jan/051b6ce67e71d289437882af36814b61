Magoti, a public affairs officer at the Legal and Human Rights Centre in Dar es Salaam, was abducted by unknown men in December last year at a busy market in the city. His family and colleagues looked for him for hours before police confirmed that they were holding him for questioning. Two days later, Magoti was arraigned in court alongside Theodory Giyan, an IT expert at a private company. They were both charged with economic crimes including money laundering, charges which are not bailable in Tanzania. Their lawyers deny all the charges. Both Magoti and Giyan are known to be critics of government on social media. Analysts in Tanzania believe such charges against dissenters may have nothing to do with actual economic offences but are a way for the government to detain them indefinitely and send a warning to other would-be critics. Rights groups have been calling for a review of laws that deny bail to suspects accused of some of economic offences. --BBC--
