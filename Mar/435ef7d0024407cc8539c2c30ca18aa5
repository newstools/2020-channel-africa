Making his third PGA Tour Champions start, the 50-year-old Hall of Famer from South Africa closed with a 4-under 67 to finish at 16-under 197. He opened with a 66 and shot 64 on Saturday. "It was pretty tight," Els told the PGA Tour Champions website. "I felt a little uncomfortable on the greens.Â 

"I didn't have that free-flowing feeling, I had to work hard for it and that's a good thing to do, to work hard for something. You don't want something falling in your lap. I'm glad the first one's over with and we can move on now and it gets more comfortable after this." Els lost a playoff to Miguel Angel Jimenez in his debut in the season-opening Mitsubishi Electric Championship in Hawaii, then tied for 34th last week in the Cologuard Classic in Arizona. "After being in a playoff in Hawaii, coming close to winning there, I didn't want to mess this one up," Els said. "I had a great opportunity and I wanted to try and take that." Fellow Hall of Famer Fred Couples, trying to win the event from the third time at age 60, finished with a 66 to tie for second with Glen Day and Robert Karlsson. Couples, also part of the playoff in Hawaii, parred the final six holes, chunking a chip on 18 to squander a good birdie try. "I butchered the two par 5s coming in," Couples said. "Other than that, I had a really, really good round." Day birdied Nos. 14-17 to take the lead at 15 under, then bogeyed the 18th for a 64. Karlsson bogeyed the 16 and parred the last two in a 66.
