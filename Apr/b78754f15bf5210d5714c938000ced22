Italy, which is the world's hardest hit country in terms of number of deaths from the virus, has extended its lockdown until Easter. Dinah Wobuyaga told Uganda's NBS television via a video link that she was not entitled to food relief in Italy as she was not a citizen. She said she and other Ugandan students had reached out to the Ugandan embassy two weeks ago for help, but nothing had been forthcoming. From Saturday, Uganda's government intends to distribute relief food locally to 1.5 million vulnerable people are to each receive 6kg of maize flour, 3kg of beans and salt. Breastfeeding women and the sick will each also be given 2kg of powdered milk and 2kg of sugar. Wobuyaga said she wanted those living abroad to be considered as well. â€œWe are not working, we do not get any funds from anywhere except the scholarships we got which are done," the student said. --BBC--
