Despite the deadly coronavirus outbreak, Mthethwa had given the green light for the PSL to resume behind closed doors. However, prior to the minister's thumbs-up, Jordaan had already issued a statement confirming that matches were suspended indefinitely. There were media reports of animosity between Jordaan and Khoza after a meeting between the two association heads scheduled for Tuesday, March 17 was cancelled by the latter. But Jordaan revealed that despite Mthethwa issuing a go ahead for matches to resume, the final decision had already been made by SAFA. Khoza addressed the same issue by stating that the PSL and SAFA were on the same page and to clear the air, Mthethwa held a meeting with the two association heads on Tuesday, March 24.

All football activities have been halted ahead of the country's 21-day lockdown that will take effect from Thursday, as announced by President Cyril Ramaphosa on Monday.
