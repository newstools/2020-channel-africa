That's about 10% of all medics who've become infected by coronavirus worldwide, despite Africa recording far fewer infections than other continents - only 700,000 out of more than 15 million global cases. The WHO attributes the high rate to a shortage of personal protective equipment. The majority of those infected are nurses, who spend longer on the wards. --BBC--
