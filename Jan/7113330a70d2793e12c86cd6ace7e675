Azevedo will travel to the US for negotiations, Trump said Wednesday at a news conference to close his visit to the World Economic Forum annual conference in Davos, Switzerland. “We’re talking about a whole new structure for the deal or we’ll have to do something, but the World Trade Organization has been very unfair to the United States for many, many years,” Trump said. He and Azevedo are discussing something “very dramatic,” he said. Azevedo joined him for the news conference. The World Trade Organization (WTO) “has to be updated. It has to be changed. It has to be reformed. This is an agenda that is squarely before members,” he said. “I don’t think anybody in Geneva misses the point.” --News24--
