The Australian world No 15 will join 16 of the world's top 20 players in Forth Worth, Texas, this week for the Charles Schwab Challenge, as the tour emerges from a 90-day shutdown caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Leishman knows that the strong fields mean it will be extremely tough to repeat the feat he achieved at the Farmers Insurance Open in January when he clinched his fifth PGA Tour title. "The fields for the first few events are so strong that they will feel a bit like the majors and that will help with motivation," Leishman told AAP. "Winning again and making sure I secure a really good starting position for the (season-ending) Tour Championship (in August) will keep me pretty fired up." The players will have to deal with a number of health regulations put in place to help curb the spread of the coronavirus, including regular nasal swab testing, social distancing and the absence of crowds, while they will also be trialing new innovations like the wearing of microphones by selected players. "There have already been some very awkward fist bumps when someone has gone in for a handshake with me but realised we can't and withdrawn and that's going to happen for a few months," Leishman said. "Getting a four-inch swab shoved up your nostril is different, but that's expected and it's a measure to keep us all safe. "It's going to be weird without crowds; it'll be funny if I wave to a non-existent crowd when I make a birdie putt," Leishman quipped. NEWS24--
