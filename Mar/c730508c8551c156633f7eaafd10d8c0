As we reported earlier rapid test kits to diagnose coronavirus are being developed in a laboratory in Senegal's capital, Dakar. Dr Sall said the infrastructure to build the kits will be ready in two weeks' time and they will probably launch them in June. The current process for testing for coronavirus infections involves taking a throat swab, transporting the swab to a laboratory and a wait for results that can take up to 24 hours, reports Quartz. In comparison, the test kits being developed in Senegal should give a result within 10 minutes. --BBC--
