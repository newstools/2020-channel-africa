Gen Musharraf had challenged the formation of special court which found him guilty of treason last December. On Monday, the Lahore High Court sided with the exiled general, who seized power in a 1999 coup and was president from 2001 to 2008. The decision meant Gen. Musharraf was "a free man", one prosecutor said. "The filing of the complaint, the constitution of the court, the selection of the prosecution team are illegal, declared to be illegal. And at the end of the day the full judgment has been set aside," the Government Prosecutor, Ishtiaq A. Khan, explained to news agency AFP. He added there was "no judgment against him any longer". According to BBC Urdu, the long-running case, which relates to Musharrafâ€™s suspension of the constitution in 2007, when he declared an emergency in a move intended to extend his tenure, could still be retried in another court. The indictment in 2014 was a highly significant moment in a country where the military has held sway for much of its independent history, with no other military leader ever facing such legal consequences for their actions. When the verdict finally came in December, it was strongly opposed by both the military and the current government. But the penalty was unlikely to be carried out. Musharraf, who has always denied any wrongdoing, was allowed to leave Pakistan in 2016 on medical grounds and is in Dubai where he is receiving medical treatment. The ruling allowed for this, saying if he died before he could be executed "his corpse (should) be dragged to D-Chowk, (outside parliament in) Islamabad, Pakistan, and be hanged for three days". The directive sparked outrage, with the government seeking to disbar the panel's head judge, according to news agency Reuters. --BBC--
