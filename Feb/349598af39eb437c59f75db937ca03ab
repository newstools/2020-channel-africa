The tough stand comes after closed door meeting between President Salva Kiir and his rival, Riek Machar hit a deadlock on the number of devolved states the country will have and their boundaries. The government wants 32 states while the rebels want a return to the initial 10 states. The formation of the unity government was postponed twice in May and November 2019. East African leaders meeting in Ethiopia's capital, Addis Ababa, said in a statement that an extension for the talks is "neither desirable nor feasible at this stage of the peace process". President Kiir told the regional body, Inter-Governmental Authority on Development (Igad), that he will consult further and report back on 15 February. --BBC--
