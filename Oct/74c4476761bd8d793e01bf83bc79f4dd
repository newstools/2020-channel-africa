Maalim Seif Sharif was at a polling station on Tuesday morning when police officers hauled him away, his ACT Wazalendo party said. United States Ambassador to Tanzania Donald Wright said he was "alarmed by reports from Zanzibar and elsewhere of violence, deaths and detentions". Police have denied killing three people on Pemba on Monday. Zanzibar is a group of islands off the coast of Tanzania which have semi-autonomous status from the mainland.

In Zanzibar, residents vote for the islands' leaders, including the election of a Zanzibari president, as well as in Tanzania's national election. The authorities have yet to comment on Sharif's alleged arrest, but an assistant commissioner of police in Pemba told the BBC that officers used tear gas on Monday to disperse locals who wanted to invade polling centres. Tanzania's police chief Simon Sirro said police did not kill three people in Pemba, adding that 42 people had been arrested in connection with the violence. Internet users across Tanzania have also reported difficulties accessing WhatsApp and Twitter ahead of the polls. Â
