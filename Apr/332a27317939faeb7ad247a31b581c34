Around 60% of chief executives are preparing for a U-shaped recovery - a long period between recession and an upturn - compared with 22% who predict a double-dip recession, according to an April 15-19 poll of 3,534 chief executives from 109 countries conducted by YPO, a business leadership network. The survey found that 11% of Chief Executives see coronavirus as a risk to the survival of their firm, while a further 40% say the pandemic poses a severe threat. “We have not seen a crisis like this for over a hundred years, and some household names will not survive,” said Glenn Keys, Executive Chairperson of Aspen Medical, a Sydney-based health services firm and YPO member. Business leaders in the hospitality and restaurant sectors were the most vulnerable with 41% of executives saying their firms were at risk of not surviving, while 30% in aviation and 19% in wholesale and retail sales feared they may go under, the survey found. There are some beneficiaries, with 10% of sector-specific retail and wholesale leaders as well as heads of production firms in agriculture, factories, mines and utilities reporting a positive impact to their revenue. However, most chief executives expect things to get worse before they get better. Almost two-thirds of business leaders forecast a negative impact on earnings to continue for more than a year, while a quarter expect their workforce to be down by more than 20% a year from now. “Across the globe, the mindset of the business leader is clearly that the world has changed in a very short space of time,” said Scott Mordell, YPO’s Chief Executive. “We are in unchartered waters, filled with an unprecedented number of pitfalls, that are challenging some businesses’ very existence.”
