China has already been postponed, but now the other three races at the top of the calendar - Australia, Bahrain and Vietnam - are in doubt. F1 CEO Chase Carey said in a teleconference that the sport is indeed "heading to Melbourne, heading to Bahrain and heading to Hanoi." But even in Barcelona for winter testing, members of the Italian-based Ferrari and Alpha Tauri teams have had to stay at home. Ferrari's Mattia Binotto revealed: "A number of engineers did not come here as a precaution. So it is definitely a concern for us. Â We are being cautious and ensuring we are acting properly." A series of crisis meetings have been scheduled in Barcelona, with the biggest concern being how team staff are able to fly into countries with restrictions.
