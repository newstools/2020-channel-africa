Since Tuesday morning, WhatsApp users have been failing to download photos or videos and can only send and receive text messages via the chat application. Twitter is also down and can only be accessed via VPN. The access to Instagram and YouTube is also restricted as the country's general election results continue to stream in. The internet monitor Net Blocks reported "widespread internet disruption" that affected Twitter, WhatsApp, Instagram and Google services, ProtonVPN - an open source VPN provider - said on Twitter that the authorities were now trying to block VPN services. People went to the polls this week in the general election where President John Magufuli, who has been accused of clamping down on public freedoms, is seeking a second five-year term.
