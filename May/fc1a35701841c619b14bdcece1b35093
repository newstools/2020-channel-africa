The United midfielder Pogba has been heavily linked with a move away from Old Trafford since admitting he was ready for a "new challenge" last summer, however, he failed to secure a move to the likes of Real Madrid ahead of the current season. Since then, he has managed just eight appearances in all competitions for the Red Devils due to injury and his time with the Premier League side has been plunged into further doubt. Madrid continues to be linked with Pogba, however, Juventus, who sold him to United for a massive $109 million four years ago, are interested in re-signing the World Cup-winning midfielder when the next transfer window opens. The price tag of the Frenchman is proving to be a problem for the Italian giants though, and reports emerging from Italian outlet Gazzetta dello Sport claim they are willing to use Bernardeschi as a makeweight in any potential deal as they look to bring Pogba's fee down. The Italian winger, 26, joined Juve from Fiorentina for $44 million in July 2017 and has made 94 appearances for 'the Old Lady' so far, scoring nine goals and assisting a further 12.
