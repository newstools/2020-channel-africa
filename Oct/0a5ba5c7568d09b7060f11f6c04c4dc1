The decision is the latest step in a long-running feud between the US and EU over state subsidies for Boeing and EU rival Airbus. In 2019, the WTO cleared the US to impose tariffs on $7.5bn in EU items. But the US said the EU should not move forward with tariffs of its own. America's top trade negotiator Robert Lighthizer said the US had removed the offending subsidies for Boeing, tax breaks granted by the state of Washington, earlier this year. The EU says the same is true of US tariffs imposed against subsidies to the A380 plane which is being taken out of production. "Because Washington State repealed that tax break earlier this year, the EU has no valid basis to retaliate against any US products," Lighthizer said. "Any imposition of tariffs based on a measure that has been eliminated is plainly contrary to WTO principles and will force a US response." On Twitter, EU Trade Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis said the EU would "immediately re-engage with the US" and strongly preferred a "negotiated settlement". European officials have been pushing the US to remove the taxes the US imposed on European goods following the WTO ruling last year. "Otherwise, we will be forced to defend our interests and respond in a proportionate way", Mr Dombrovskis added. --BBC--
