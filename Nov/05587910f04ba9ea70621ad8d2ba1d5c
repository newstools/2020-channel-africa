Ethnic violence has been on the rise in the country, with an attack on Sunday in Oromia state resulting in the death of 32 people. The Ethiopian Human Rights Commission (EHRC) said members of the Amhara ethnic group, the country's second largest ethnic group, were targeted in the attack. Mahamat, in a statement, urged "refrain from inflammatory rhetoric" and called for dialogue on key issues. He stressed the need to "work towards de-escalating tensions in the country". --BBC--
