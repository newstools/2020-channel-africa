FIFA says it firmly believes that the health and well-being of all individuals involved in sporting activities should always be the highest priority, and as such they welcome the decision. Citing the need to safeguard health, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) issued a joint statement earlier on Tuesday with Japanese leader Shinzo Abe postponing the Games until 2021. "Further to the IOC's decision, FIFA will work with relevant stakeholders to address all key matters related to this rescheduling," the statement added.
