Sasol is now expecting to produce approximately 7.3-7.4 million tons of synfuel against the previously guided range of 7.7–7.8 million tons, the company said in a statement to the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. It is also targeting sales of 50–51 million barrels of liquid fuel for the financial year 2020, against 57–58 million barrels previously, it said. Synfuel or synthetic fuel is a form of liquid fuel made from coal in South Africa. Sasol is the world’s biggest producer of motor fuel from coal. South African President, Cyril Ramaphosa, imposed a nationwide lockdown at the end of March to contain spread of the deadly coronavirus, which has already infected 1 749 people in the country and killed 13. The lockdown, which prompted rating agency Moody’s to downgrade the country’s sovereign rating to junk, crashed domestic demand at a time when the economy had already slipped into a recession. --Reuters--
