The index is published annually by Transparency International and assesses the perceived levels of public sector corruption in 180 countries. According to Transparency, the country's poor rule of law has created a room for "petty bribery to high-level political corruption". Somalia is this year preparing to hold its first “one-person-one vote” in over 50 years. The East African country has been ravaged by a decades-long civil war, and more recently, attacks by Islamist militant groups. Transparency International has urged for the establishment of structures for "political accountability to facilitate anti-corruption mechanisms". Somalia's government has in the past dismissed similar poor rankings in the CPI as ‘unreliable and falsehood’. The country’s Finance Minister Abdirahman Duale Beyle at some point threatened to sue Transparency International. The country has recently made progress in talks with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank on debt relief.
