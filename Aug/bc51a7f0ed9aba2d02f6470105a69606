“In line with our commitments under the Paris Agreement to Combat Climate Change, we are moving ahead with both mitigation strategies to reduce our carbon emissions and adaptation strategies to prepare our society for the effects of climate change.” President Cyril Ramaphosa said work is already underway in government and in the private sector to respond to climate change, with tangible projects being implemented at both national and provincial government level. In provinces such as Gauteng and the Western Cape, new low-carbon technologies are being used to power public transport, with thousands of solar water heaters already installed in public housing. “As we build a new economy, we cannot afford to be out of step with international moves towards green growth and green development,” he said. The country’s major trading partners have signalled a move towards “carbon border taxes” to exclude products from those countries that they consider to be violating their climate change commitments, said the President. South Africa’s research and development activity has long engaged with the green economy. The country has already made significant advances in the waste and recycling economies. --SANews--
