According to the Nile Post website, Uganda has allowed the importation of 4,000 doses of Sars-Cov-2 inactivated vaccine (VeroCell) to be "strictly" used by the Chinese community at Kapeeka Industrial Park in the central Nakaseke district. The Chinese nationals had reportedly requested Uganda to help them import the vaccines from China. Health Minister Jane Ruth Aceng said the move would help Uganda curb Covid-19 infections from the Chinese community affiliated with the park. --BBC--
