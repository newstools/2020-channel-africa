The EACâ€™s report on Trade and Investment (2019) shows that Kenya and Tanzanian have borne the brunt of these losses by letting go an estimated $702.76 million and $497.18 million per year respectively. Rwanda has been losing on average $201.25 million per year on tax exemptions and duty remissions over the five-year period, followed by Uganda ($80.9 million) and Burundi ($79.86 million). The EAC has been implementing an exemption and remission scheme since the EAC Customs Union was established in 2005. The system involves granting exemption and remission to a number of products that is usually geared towards reducing local production costs and encouraging growth of the export market. Duty exemption schemes allow duty free import of inputs which are used in the production of goods destined for the export market while a Duty Remission Scheme provides for post export replenishment/remission of duty on inputs used in the export product. Last year, the value of revenue foregone as a result of remissions and exemptions increased in all the Partner States according to the report. In Burundi, the revenue foregone grew by 6.1% to $ 89.25 million in 2019 from $84.09 million in 2018 while in Uganda the revenue foregone increased by 6.4% to $93.8 million in the same period. In Kenya the value of goods subject to exemptions increased by 4.3% to $3.1 billion in 2019 from $3 billion in 2018 while the duty foregone increased marginally by 0.9% to $740.81 from $733.99 million. In Tanzania the value of goods subject to exemptions and remissions increased by 10.2% to $2 billion from $1.8 billion while the total amount of revenue foregone increased by 20.9% to $533 million from $440.75 million. In Rwanda total Customs revenue increased by 36.4%, to $503.8 million with Excise duty and VAT on imports recording an increase of 4.2% and 20.6%, respectively. --TheEastAfrican--
