On Thursday, a coronavirus patient died in northern Hebei province, making it the first death outside Hubei. Another death was later confirmed in north-east Heilongjiang province. The province borders Russia and is more than 2000 kilometres from Wuhan. Nationally, there are currently 830 confirmed cases of patients infected with the virus. A small number of confirmed cases have also been found outside China, including in Thailand, the United States, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, Vietnam and Singapore. The growing list of restrictions comes on the eve of Lunar New Year, one of the most important dates in the Chinese calendar, when millions of people travel home. Travel restrictions vary from city to city. Wuhan is effectively on lockdown: all bus, subway and ferry services have been suspended and all outbound planes and trains cancelled.
