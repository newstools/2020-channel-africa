Every year, one teacher is awarded $1 million under the Global Teacher Prize for their contributions to the profession. Mokhudu Cynthia Machaba teaches at a primary school in Limpopo in northern South Africa. She told the BBC's Newsday about her teaching methods and how she wants to raise aspirations among her pupils. "I introduced project-based teaching knowing that we still have resources to experiment and practical lessons and I also use the indigenous knowledge. So I knew we grew up doing things a certain way I engaged members of the community to assist in the indigenous ways of doing things so that I can build confidence in them," she said. Machaba encourages her pupils to aim higher and those who manage to go the universities come back to thank her. Kenyan teacher Peter Tabichi, a member of the Franciscan religious order, won the prize in 2020.
