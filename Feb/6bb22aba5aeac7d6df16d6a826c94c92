A death certificate for the basketball legend, who was killed in a helicopter crash outside Los Angeles on January 26 along with his daughter and seven others, states that he was buried last Friday at Pacific View Memorial Park in Corona del Mar, United States media reported. A memorial service for Bryant and Gianna is planned February 24 at the Staples Center in downtown Los Angeles which can hold 20 000 people. The Center, also the home of the NHL's Los Angeles Kings and venue for concerts and events such as the recent Grammy Awards, has hosted memorials for recording artists Michael Jackson and Nipsey Hussle. Byrant's wife, Vanessa, on Monday took to Instagram to express her grief saying "my brain refuses to accept that both Kobe and Gigi are gone. Itâ€™s like I am trying to process Kobe being gone but my body refuses to accept my Gigi will never come back to me," she added.
