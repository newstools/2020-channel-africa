Before COVID-19 struck, the president seemed stuck in a quagmire of consensus-building , battling to reform an economy in recession, weighed down by failing state companies and a ballooning public sector wage bill, against opposition from trade unions and within his own party. But since ordering one of strictest lockdowns in the world a month ago, Ramaphosa has won praise for taking bold and sometimes unpopular steps to prevent a runaway epidemic like those that have devastated the United States and western Europe. South Africa has confirmed 3,635 cases and 65 deaths so far. He has also marshalled $26.16 billion, or 10% of national output, to fight the virus, keep businesses afloat and prevent the poor who make up half the population of Africa’s most industrialised nation from going hungry. All this is political capital he can spend on pushing through reforms. “Before the crisis, the biggest policy bottleneck was caused by a lack of consensus within the alliance,” said Ralph Mathekga, analyst and author of Ramaphosa’s Turn, referring to Ramaphosa’s African National Congress (ANC) and its allies. “When this crisis came about ... a window of opportunity emerged. Ramaphosa’s opponents in the ANC are frozen.” Even the opposition Economic Freedom Fighters, who built a platform on heckling the ruling ANC as stooges of imperialist capitalism, are issuing statements agreeing with Ramaphosa. --Reuters--
