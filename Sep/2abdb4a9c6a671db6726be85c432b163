The workers want, among other things, basic working materials, protective equipment, better salaries, and the right to form a union. Their leader, Joseph Tamba, called a talk radio show on OK FM on Wednesday morning saying he had gone into hiding because of he was receiving threats. But Information Minister, Eugene Nagbe disputed Tamba's statement. He said the government had made "some overtures" to address the healthcare workers’ concerns. He, however, warned that the names of those who will continue with the strike “will be removed from the payroll and replaced” in accordance with, he said, the civil service law. Local reporters calling the radio programme from different parts of the country said the strike was ongoing at many health facilities. --BBC--
