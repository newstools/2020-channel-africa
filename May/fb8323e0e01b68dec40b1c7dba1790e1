The elections are only nine days away and the order effectively bars observers from scrutinising the voting process. Burundi has proposed that EAC's staff who are already in the country take up the role of observers, according to a letter written by Isabelle Ndaayo, the minister responsible East African Community affairs. The country has also declined to allow United Nations and civil society observers to monitor the elections. The last election held in 2015 was criticised by regional and international bodies for lacking the conditions for credible and free elections. Meanwhile, a tense electoral campaign is under way with frequent reports of violence and intimidation of officials and supporters of the main opposition National Congress for Liberty.
