Attackers breached heavy security at Camp Simba at dawn but were pushed back and four jihadists killed, said army spokesman Colonel Paul Njuguna. The American military, however, said three US citizens died in the attack including a service member and two civilian defence contractors. "Our thoughts and prayers are with the families and friends of our teammates who lost their lives today," General Stephen Townsend, the head of US Africa Command (Africom), said in a statement. Two other US Department of Defence personnel were wounded, the statement added, without giving further details. Al-Shabaab has launched regular cross-border raids since Kenya sent troops into Somalia in 2011 as part of an African Union force protecting the internationally backed government - which the jihadists have been trying to overthrow for more than a decade. The Lamu region, which includes popular tourist beach destination Lamu Island, lies close to the Somali frontier and has suffered frequent attacks, often carried out with roadside bombs. Njuguna said "an attempt was made to breach security at Manda Air Strip" at 05:30 but it was repulsed. "Four terrorists' bodies have so far been found. The airstrip is safe," he said, adding that a fire had broken out but had since been dealt with. Kenya's Inspector General of Police Hilary Mutyambai said officers were "on high alert" after the attack. --News24--
