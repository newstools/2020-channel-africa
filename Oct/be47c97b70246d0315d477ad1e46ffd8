Chinhoi and countryman, Visitor Mapwanya, are making strides on the East African Golf tour where they have managed several top 10 finishes after the national lockdown. The Zimbabwean walked away with the top prize at the weekend following a brilliant round of five-under-par 67 in the closing round. Playing in the final round, Chinhoi birdied two holes in the first nine’s second and seventh holes. A birdie at the par four 10th and more birdies at the 15th, 17th and 18th were enough for him to win by six strokes. “My tee shots were solid, as I made all the fairways, though I also missed a number of putts, particularly, in the first nine where I felt a bit nervous, which is normal, when you are playing in the final round and with good players,” he told the Nation newspaper. His plan is to win a couple of events to qualify for the 2021 Magical Kenya Open. --Herald--
