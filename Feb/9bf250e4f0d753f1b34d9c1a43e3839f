Energy Minister, Tom Alweendo, on Friday announced that for February fuel prices will remain unchanged. However, the unchanged prices do not mean there are no movements in the cost of fuel, the minister said, but that the National Energy Fund is in a healthy position to absorb any under recoveries for the month.

Meanwhile, Alweendo noted that the International Maritime Organisation's new regulations that call for the prevention of pollution from ships, lowering the maximum sulfur content of marine fuel used in ocean-going vessels from 3.5% of weight to 0.5%, meant that freight rates or the transportation costs of bulk fuel by sea have increased. 

“This has been reflected in the latest Basic Fuel Price calculations done by the Ministry of Mines and Energy. Under recoveries normally call for equivalent increases in local fuel pump prices. However, the National Energy Fund remains in a healthy financial position and will thus absorb the under recoveries on behalf of the consumers during this month,” Alweendo noted.

Moreover, other factors that contributed to the stable local fuel prices are the price per barrel and the exchange rate for 2019. He added that the review is conducted from time to time to ensure business sustainability in the fuel retail industry.
