Esterhuizen and Louw, who joined Harlequins from the Sharks and Stormers respectively, have yet to arrive but are expected in London this weekend. Harlequins coach Paul Gustard told BBC Sport he was frustrated by the delay as Quins host Sale Sharks at the Twickenham Stoop on Friday. "The ability to get in and get the necessary paperwork done, with the number of places shut down, has taken us a lot longer than we anticipated," Gustard said. "But we have got numbers and it will be a nice boost when these players arrive and give us a lift." Esterhuizen and Louw, who are both 26, have played eight and 13 Tests respectively. Meanwhile, Harlequins also signed Lions back Tyrone Green and experienced tighthead prop Maks van Dyk from Toulon, both of whom have been included in the squad for the rest of the 2019-20 season. --BBC--
