MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan lost 0.5% while Japan's Nikkei .N225 dropped 0.5%. United States (US) S&P 500 futures ESc1 sagged 0.27% in Asia after major US stock indexes ended the previous session lower, with the S&P 500 .SPX closing down 0.7% and the Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC shedding 0.8%. Disappointing quarterly results from Bank of America BAC.N and Wells Fargo WFC.N led the S&P 500 banks index .SPXBK 2.4% lower. Concerns that a resurgence in the COVID-19 pandemic could lead governments to again shut down economies spurred profit-taking, particularly after the recent stock rally. With COVID-19 cases surging, some European nations are closing schools, cancelling surgery and enlisting student medics as overwhelmed authorities braced for a repeat of the nightmare scenario seen earlier in 2020. That helped push the German 10-year Bunds yield to as low as minus 0.586% , a rate last seen in May 2020.
