The rebel group called Return, Reclamation, Rehabilitation (3R) has been blamed for the attack. In a statement, the UN Mission in the Central African Republic (Minusca) said the attack in Gedze, in the country's north-west region, violated a peace agreement by the 3R group and its Leader, Abass Sidiki. UN Secretary-General, Antonio Gutteres, in a statement expressed condolences to the family of the victim as well as to the Rwandan government. "The secretary-general recalls that attacks against United Nations peacekeepers may constitute war crimes under international law," the statement noted. The UN Secretary-General also called on state authorities "to spare no effort in identifying the perpetrators of this attack so that they can be brought to justice swiftly". Numerous rebel groups have been operating in the country since President François Bozizé was overthrown seven years ago. --BBC--
