Any company with close ties to them would be barred from bidding for government contracts, he added. Condé, 82, was speaking at a ceremony where he was sworn in for a controversial third term following an election which was marred by violence and opposition allegations of fraud. His inauguration in the capital, Conakry, was attended by 11 African leaders. Condé said a constitutional referendum in March allowed him to run again, despite a two-term limit for presidents. Amnesty International says since October’s vote Guinean security forces have killed at least a dozen people and arrested hundreds in opposition strongholds. Amnesty described President Condé's swearing in as the culmination of a process involving serious and widespread human rights violations carried out with complete impunity. --BBC--
