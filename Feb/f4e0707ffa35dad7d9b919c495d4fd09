The estranged wife of Zimbabwe's Vice-President, Constatino Chiwenga, Marry Mubaiwa, has been denied access to their children and their home. A high court dismissed Mubaiwa's application in which she was seeking access to her home and children. She was ordered to live in her parents' house until her case is heard. Mubaiwa was arrested in December and charged with attempting to murder Chiwenga, and of being involved in fraud and money laundering. She was released on bail on 6 January and ordered to surrender her diplomatic passport and the title deeds of a property registered in her father's name as part of her bail conditions. Since then she has been filing applications to be allowed to access to the house she lived in with Chiwenga. --BBC--
