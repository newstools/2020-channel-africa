Total number of deaths has risen to 24,” he said. Meanwhile, human rights monitoring organisation Amnesty International says it is concerned about the SA government’s plans to ‘de-densify’ some informal settlements, after a “worrying” report about police conduct in a Western Cape camp. GroundUpreported on Tuesday that homeless people at the Strandfontein Sports Grounds, Cape Town, were shot at with rubber bullets by police after they began to protest, breaking down a fence and throwing stones about conditions at the tent camp. The facility was set up as part of the national lockdown to disrupt the spread of Covid-19. --Timeslive--
