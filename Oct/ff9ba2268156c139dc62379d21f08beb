Tsunoda, a protege of Alpha Tauri's engine partner Honda, is a potential candidate for a race seat at the team in 2021. Tsunoda hopes to cover the 300km that would qualify him to take part in a Friday practice session, if the team chose to run him in one. After the test there are four races remaining where that could happen. Tsunoda, 20, is third in the Formula 2 championship with two races remaining, a position that would guarantee him the 'super licence' required to race in F1. "My main priority is to do those 300 kilometres," he said on Wednesday as he had a seat fitting at the Alpha Tauri factory in preparation for the test, which will come at the wheel of a 2018 car. "I don't want to crash or go off the track because the more mileage I do, the more I can understand the car, so I will take it easy. "But I am confident that I can do it and I will drive the way I normally do. I will focus on my job while enjoying my first day in a Formula 1 car. "I am sure I will be very excited when I'm sitting in the car waiting for the green light at the end of the pit lane." Alpha Tauri have already said they plan to run Tsunoda in the young driver test after the season finale in Abu Dhabi. Until Honda announced its decision to withdraw from F1 at the end of 2021, Tsunoda was considered close to a certainty to take the seat at Alpha Tauri currently occupied by Russian Daniil Kvyat.
