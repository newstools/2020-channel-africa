Production has also been affected by the firm's move to place the mine under care and maintenance due to the impact of low pricing on its liquidity. A Petra statement issued on Thursday showed that Williamson production for a full year to June totalled 298 130 carats compared to 399 615 carats during a similar period the previous year. The production was impacted by the pit slump of approximately 1.3 million tons that occurred at the mine in January in an area on the south western sector of the pit as well as the decision to place the mine on care and maintenance during April," Petra, controlling the largest diamond mine in the country, said. The statement further said the mine in Tanzania remains under care and maintenance and recommencement of operations "is dependent on improved market conditions and rough diamond pricing." For the year up to June, Williamson Capital Expenditure (Capex) of $8 million mainly related to in-pit waste removal and concurrent slimes dam extensions, and the extension of the tailings disposal infrastructure. For 2021, Capex is guided at ca. $7 million, primarily related to the on-going waste removal, focused mainly on removal of the pit slump material, and concurrent slimes dam extensions, and the completion of the tailings disposal facilities. It also includes Stay in Business Capex. Production fell 7% year-on-year, partly because Petra's Williamson mine in Tanzania has been shut since the start of April. The Group reported a full-year revenue to June drop 36% as the Covid-19 pandemic dealt a fresh blow to a struggling diamond industry. --AllAfrica--
