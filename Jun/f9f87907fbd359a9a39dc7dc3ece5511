The First Vice-President, Gaston Sindimwo, on Thursday chaired an extraordinary Council of Ministers cabinet meeting which agreed to refer the issue to the apex court. Cabinet wants the court “to declare the vacancy of the post of President of the Republic following the death of Nkurunziza,” a tweet by the VP’s office said. The vacancy will pave the way for the appointment of a replacement for the former President. Nkurunziza was due to hand over power to Evariste Ndayishimiye who won May 2020 elections. Reports after the demise of Nkurunziza suggested that the Head of National Assembly, Pascal Nyabenda, was expected to play the acting role till the investiture of Ndayishimiye. Incidentally, in the issuance of condolences to the government, Chad for instance addressed its official message to Vice-President Simdimwo whiles the Botswana president addressed his message to Pascal Nyabenda referring to him as President of National Assembly and Acting President of Burundi. --AfricaNews--
