Albeit short of details or timelines, the address touched on salient issues including a dire need to augment power supply to alleviate pressure on Eskom.

However, Fitch Ratings dismissed the Sona as underwhelming; while the address highlighted challenges to the credit outlook, promised progress is overshadowed by partial detail on key policy areas, including land reform.

The Rand is set to brace for a bumpy road ahead this quarter as we expect that a disappointing budget will prelude a downgrade by Moody’s. 

At the close of local trade, the Rand quoted 0.47% stronger at R14.85/$. The Rand traded firmer this morning. Expected range today R14.75/$ - R15.00/$.
