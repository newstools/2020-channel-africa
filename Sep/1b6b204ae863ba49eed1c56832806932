Mohammed Jabbateh was found guilty of immigration fraud for falsely telling US authorities in the 1990s that he had never belonged to an armed group. One witness told the court in 2018 how Jabbateh had ordered the heart of a captive to be cooked for his fighters. The court's decision to uphold the sentence "should serve as an encouragement to all Liberians to stand up for justice and fight impunity," said Hassan Bility of the Global Justice and Research Project. Around 250,000 people were killed in Liberia's 14-year civil war. --BBC--
