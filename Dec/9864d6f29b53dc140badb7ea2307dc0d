Soliana Shimelis, the board's communication adviser, told the BBC that preparations were underway. Opposition parties have however complained that a government crackdown against its officials had disrupted their plans to prepare for the polls. The Oromo Liberation Front (OLF) said almost all of its leaders and party officials are under arrest while its offices including the main office in the capital Addis Ababa are either "ransacked, closed or are under state control." The government has not responded to these allegations. Another opposition party Oromo Federalist Congress (OFC) has also announced that it was going to be difficult for it to take part in the upcoming election with its leaders and members in jail. Its prominent member Jawar Mohammed and the partyâ€™s Deputy Chairman, Bekele Gerba, were arrested in June following protests that broke out after the murder of popular musician Hachalu Hundessa. They are both facing terror charges among others. The Ethiopian government accuses them of inciting violence and "trying to alter the constitutional order." Election officials expect at least 50 million people will vote to elect members of the House of Peoples Representatives, national parliament, and regional state councils. Since coming to power in 2018 Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has promised to ensure free and fair elections. Election officials postponed the poll, which had been scheduled to be held this year, due to the Covid-19 pandemic. --BBC--
