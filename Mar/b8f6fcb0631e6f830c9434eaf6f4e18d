Trailing 3-2 from the first leg, Zambia won through on away goals after drawing 4-4 on aggregate. Mary Mwakapila and Hellen Mubanga scored first-half goals for the Copper Queens, before Nchout Ajara's 92nd-minute goal ensured a nervy finish. Yet joyous scenes filled the Nkoloma Stadium as Zambia reached Tokyo. Zambia are only the fifth African side to reach the Olympics' women's football tournament, after Cameroon, Nigeria, South Africa and Zimbabwe.
