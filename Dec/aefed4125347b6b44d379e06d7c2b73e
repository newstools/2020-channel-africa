Francis Ndulane, who was to become Assistant Minister in the Mines Ministry, attempted to say the words several times before being asked to take a seat as other nominees were called to take their oath. A video of the event attended by President John Magufuli has been shared on Twitter. In his remarks Magufuli said that he had reviewed the CVs of all nominees before appointing them but added that Ndulane would be replaced. "I will give this position to someone who can take the oath properly," the president said. He told Ndulane that he will keep his Member of Parliament seat but "we will have to get a replacement". Ndulane has not commented on why he struggled to take the oath. --BBC-
