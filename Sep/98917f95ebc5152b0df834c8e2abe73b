However, firm international gold prices partly offset damage caused by volumes decline. The diversified miner, which also has interests in diamond, coal and nickel processing, said payment delays for gold deliveries to Fidelity Printers and Refiners, a unit of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, had remained inconsistent albeit amid the payments being intermittent. This, the miner noted, had resulted in stock outs of key raw materials required in the production of bullion. The company said it was still owed a substantial amount and can only produce to the extent it has adequate inputs. RioZim, which operates three gold mines namely Renco Mine in Masvingo, Cam and Motor in Kadoma and Dalny Mine in Chegutu, said output fell 39 % to 986 kilogrammes in the half year period compared to the same period last year. Power shortages negatively impacted mill throughput while persistent mill breakdowns and low grade ore from One Step Mine also weighed down on performance, one of Zimbabwe’s biggest gold mines said this week. The resultant low production, coupled with rising costs caused the group to incur losses of $77. 4 million compared to $38.2 million in 2019, which came on the back of subdued revenue of $614 million. The low volumes were, however, partly offset by the favourable gold price, which averaged $1,713 per ounce, an increase of 27 % from $1,346 per ounce in the same prior period,” RioZim said. Production at Renco Mine, at 288kg, outpaced the prior comparative period by 11 % largely driven by better plant availability. Cam and Motor produced 199kg, down from 489kg last year. Plant and equipment breakdowns affected throughput and gold output. --Herald--
