Brent crude LCOc1 was down 47 cents, or 1.4%, at $32.75 a barrel by 0317 GMT after falling more than 7% on Thursday. For the week, Brent is set to fall nearly 28%, the biggest weekly decline since the week of January18, 1991, when it fell 29% at the outbreak of the first Gulf War. United States West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 was down 54 cents, or 1.7%, at $30.96 after falling more than $1 earlier. The contract fell 4.5% in the previous session. WTI is set to drop 25% this week, the most since the week of December 19, 2008, when it fell 27% at the height of the Global Financial Crisis. As travel bans, cancelled events and other economic disruptions eat into crude demand, major oil producers are announcing plans to add more crude to an oversupplied market. A flood of low-priced oil from Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest exporter, and the United Arab Emirates is intensifying the pressure on prices after the collapse of a price supporting agreement with Russia last week. Russia, the world’s second-largest producer, does not appear willing to return to the agreement with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. Domestic oil producers met with Russian Energy Minister, Alexander Novak, on Thursday but did not discuss returning to the deal, with the head of Gazprom Neft saying they plan to raise output in April.
