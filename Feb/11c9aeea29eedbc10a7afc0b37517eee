In January alone, at least 60 people were killed in four separate attacks in the north of the country. Members of parliament recently unanimously voted in favour of arming civilians in a move they said would help combat armed groups. It is due to be signed into law. Any national aged 18 and over who has a "spirit of sacrifice" can be considered for recruitment and there is no maximum age. But recruits cannot be part of any political group or party. The attacks by militants linked to al-Qaeda and the Islamic State group have significantly increased in the past year, causing more than half a million people to flee their homes. Critics have questioned whether the new measure will make people safer, but the government insists that armed volunteers are necessary to stem the spread of violence. --BBC--
