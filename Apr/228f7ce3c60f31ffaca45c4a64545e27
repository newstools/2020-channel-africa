The survey was based on the responses of 707 business across all sectors of the SA economy. This comes as SA enters the 25th day of a nationwide lockdown, with only enterprises deemed essential, such as pharmacies and food retailers able to continue operations. While 20% of responding businesses reported layoffs "in the short term", just under a third said they had reduced staff working hours. Some 85% of businesses reported a decrease in turnover, while 75% said they expected the impact of the coronavirus pandemic to be worse than the 2008 global financial crisis. In the wake of the 2008 crisis, SA's GDP fell by 1.5% in 2009 before rebounding by 3% in 2010. The impact of the crisis caused by the virus is predicted to be far more severe, with expectations from the South African Reserve Bank of a 6.1% contraction in the economy this year. --Reutersâ€”
