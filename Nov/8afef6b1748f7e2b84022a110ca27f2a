The electoral commission has contracted a Dutch company to remove multiple registrations in the register ahead of January’s elections, the newspaper reports quoting officials. "We have started the process of authenticating the voters to ensure that only eligible voters appear on the register and that they will vote once,” the commission's spokesperson Paul Bukenya is quoted as saying. It's unclear if political parties were made aware of the cleanup. Ugandans will vote for a president and parliamentary representatives on 14 January. Eleven candidates - including long-serving incumbent Yoweri Museveni - will be vying for the top job.
