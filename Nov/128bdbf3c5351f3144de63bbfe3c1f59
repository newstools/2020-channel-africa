He said this while delivering the online 11 Annual Ahmed Kathrada Lecture under the theme ‘Hope after State Capture – Towards an Agenda for Change.’ Economies around the globe, and especially on the African continent, have been severely impacted by the pandemic which saw the implementation of nationwide shutdowns. Jonas has also called for the establishment of a new global debt authority. “We need a global debt deal for the establishment of a new global debt authority, independent of creditors and debtors interest focused on assisting developing countries with and for example sovereign debt restructuring. Dealing with debt is a small but necessary part of the global fix.” He says, “We also need a global economic stimulus and rescue plan directed mostly towards developing countries, such a global stimulus could direct global liquidity currently pooled in tax havens, for example, to create technology, digitization, and health infrastructure in the developing world and Africa in particular.” 

Meanwhile, Mcebisi Jonas says United States (US) presidential-elect Joe Biden’s victory will enhance South Africa’s path to economic recovery from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Jonas also says Biden will undo the damage done by Donald Trump – including returning the US to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. --Reuters--
