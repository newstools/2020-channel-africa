The company, a unit of Anglo American, reported headline earnings per share (HEPS) of R50.88 ($3.38) for the year ended December 31, compared with R30.28 ($20.1) a year earlier. HEPS is the primary profit measure in South Africa that strips out certain one-off items. Total revenue for the year rose 41% to R64.3 billion ($4.28 billion), compared with 45.7 billion ($3.03 billion) a year earlier. The miner said its annual revenue was driven by higher ore prices, stronger market premiums and currency gains despite lower sales volumes amid weaker domestic offtake. “Our financial performance reflects the benefits of higher iron ore prices, improved efficiencies and further cost savings ahead of our target, which have cushioned the impact of the operational challenges experienced during the period,” said Kumba Chief Executive Officer, Themba Mkhwanazi. Production, however, dropped 2% to 42.4 million tons, compared with 43.1 million tons in the year-ago period due to the impact from plant maintenance and equipment-related issues in the first half. The company said it expects to produce between 41.5 million tons and 42.5 million tons of iron ore in 2020, and declared a final cash dividend of R15.99 ($1.06) per share bringing the total dividend to R46.78 ($3.10) per share.
