The annual meetings are usually held for two consecutive years at the World Bank and IMF headquarters in Washington, and then in a member country every third year. The World Bank and IMF held virtual meetings in April and October this year due to the pandemic. No decision has been made yet on whether the spring 2021 meetings will take place in person or online. The meetings usually draw some thousands participants, including finance ministers, central bankers, private sector executives, civil society, media and academics. --Reuters--
