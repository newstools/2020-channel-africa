The 25-year-old Madrid-born forward, who began his career at Barcelona and helped Sevilla win the Europa League in August, played one match for Spain in 2014 when he debuted in a European Championship qualifier which tied him to the national team, even though he is also a Moroccan citizen through his parents. But FIFA last month tweaked the rules so that players can change their international allegiance provided they are eligible to represent a second country and have played no more than three matches for one national team at senior level, with all the appearances coming before the player turns 21. Playing at a World Cup or continental tournament also prohibits a player from switching country but appearing in a tournament qualifier or the Nations League would not. Morocco tried to pick El Haddadi for the 2018 World Cup in Russia but were stymied by FIFAâ€™s regulations, which previously allowed players to change international allegiance if they had only played at junior level or in non-competitive senior games. However, on Thursday El Haddadi, who has not been in the picture for Spain for years, was handed the chance of a new international career when he was named among eight new players in a 26-man Morocco squad for friendlies against Senegal on October 9 and Democratic Republic of Congo on October 13. Both games being played behind closed doors in Rabat. --Reuters--
