Oldon had been behind bars for more than 13 months. He was found guilty of defamation and spreading false news by a court in Hargeisa in July 2019 and sentenced to three and half years in prison. He has repeatedly denied all the charges and his lawyers termed the judgement as injustice. Somaliland President Muse Bihi Abdi on Saturday ordered for his release following pressure from opposition leaders and human rights groups. This was the second time Oldon was released through a presidential pardon. "I was released after the leaders of UCID For Justice and Development and Waddani political parties spoke to Somaliland President," Oldon told BBC Somali Service. He said he was treated well while in prison but had become ill. Since Somalia's civil war and the collapse of government in 1991, Somaliland has been a self-declared independent state and has its own government. However, it is not officially recognised by the United Nations, African Union or any country. --BBC--
