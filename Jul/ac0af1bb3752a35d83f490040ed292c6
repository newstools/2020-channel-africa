United States (US) District Judge, Indira Talwani, in Boston, said Michael Taylor and Peter Taylor, who have been detained since their May 20 arrests, have yet to show they deserve freedom, in part because a magistrate judge also weighing bail has yet to rule. The Taylors said bail was warranted because they might contract Covid-19 at the suburban Norfolk County Correctional Centre, where 36 inmates and staff have tested positive. Michael Taylor, a Special Forces veteran, is missing part of one lung. Talwani also said the Taylors have not shown it likely there was no probable cause to detain them, after they argued that the offenses described in Japan’s extradition requests would not support their extradition.   

“Petitioners have not demonstrated here the high probability of success necessary to establish special circumstances justifying release on bail in an extradition case while these legal issues are being resolved,” Talwani wrote. Lawyers for the Taylors did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Ghosn escaped in late December 2019 to his childhood home of Beirut via Istanbul from Japan, where he had been under house arrest on financial crimes charges. He was transported in a large black box to an awaiting private jet. Lebanon has no extradition treaty with Japan. At a Wednesday hearing, federal prosecutor Stephen Hassink called the Taylors an “extraordinary flight risk.” --Reuters--
