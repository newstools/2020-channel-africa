Serena also trailed 4-2 in the deciding set but claimed four straight games to win a high-quality match in Kentucky. It was the 31 competitive singles match between the sisters, with Serena now having won 19 times to Venus' 12. "I honestly don't know how I was able to pull it out at the end," said 23-time Grand Slam champion Serena. "I have been losing a lot of those tight sets so I said to myself that I really needed to win, just for my game and my confidence." Top seed Serena broke seven-time Grand Slam champion Venus, 40, in the first game of the match but faded to lose the first set 6-3 in 41 minutes, before taking the second by the same score in 50 minutes. Serena, 38, broke first in the final set but Venus fought back and looked to be on course for victory at 4-2 up. However, Serena, who also had to come from behind against Bernarda Pera in her opening match, hit some crucial winners to reach the last eight of her first tournament in six months. She will face either fellow American Shelby Rogers or Canadian Leylah Annie Fernandez in the quarter-finals of the behind-closed-doors event. In Thursday's first last-16 tie, Switzerland's Jil Teichmann beat Ukrainian fifth seed Yulia Putintseva 6-2 6-2. --BBC--
