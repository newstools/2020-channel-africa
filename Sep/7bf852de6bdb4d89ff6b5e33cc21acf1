The South African currency slumped as the country fell into darkness with loadshedding revised from stage 2 to stage 4. Embattled parastatal Eskom warned that loadshedding will persist throughout the week as the colder weather upped demand for electricity, with the increased pressure on the grid exacerbating a breakdown in multiple generation units. At the close of local trade, the rand quoted 1.48% weaker at R16.88/$, after trading in range of R16.62/$ - R16.92/$. The rand remained under pressure overnight. Expected range today R16.70/$ - R17.00/$. The JSE All Share (-0.12%) ended lower yesterday, dragged mainly by losses in large gold mining (-3.04 %) and banking (-2.80%) stocks, after Eskom ramped up loadshedding to level 4. In the overall emerging market sphere, the MSCI Emerging Market Index (-0.10%) traded weaker. --IOL--
