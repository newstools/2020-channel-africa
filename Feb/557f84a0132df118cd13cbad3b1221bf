Chinese carmaker Geely is the latest to launch a new online service to try to boost sales in the country. It joins the likes of Tesla, BMW and Mercedes-Benz who are now actively marketing cars over the internet. The online trend comes amid a downturn in car sales in China, which plummeted 92% in the first half of February. Geely, which owns black cab maker The London Electric Vehicle Company and Volvo, said customers can now order and customise their cars on its website. China's largest privately-owned car maker will also offer test drives without potential customers needing to visit the showroom, as the car can be driven directly to their home address.Â 

Geely calls it a fully "contactless" vehicle purchasing service.
