It came after the UAE issued a visa ban on Kenyans, allegedly after visitors were found using forged certificates. The suspects are due to appear on court later on Friday, according to local media. Coronavirus cases are rising in Kenya and on Thursday it tightened restrictions on public gatherings. Earlier this week, the UAE decided to stop giving visas to citizens of 13 countries, including Kenya, Somalia, Libya, Tunisia and Algeria. The 21 travellers were attempting to fly to Dubai when they were apprehended at the main airport in Kenyan capital Nairobi on Thursday. They are accused of using forged medical documents that certified they tested negative for coronavirus in advance of travel. On another recent flight, from Nairobi to Dubai, about 100 Kenyans were reportedly found with similar falsified documents and half later tested positive at the airport, according to Kenyan website Nairobi news.
