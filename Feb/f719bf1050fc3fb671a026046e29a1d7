The statement follows Trump’s visit to India on February 24-25, during which the United States President clinched the sale of $3 billion of military equipment sale to India. "They (Trump and Modi) agreed to promptly conclude the ongoing negotiations, which they hope can become phase one of a comprehensive bilateral trade agreement that reflects the true ambition and full potential of the bilateral commercial relations", the White House said late on Tuesday, giving no details on what would be included in the deal. Earlier on Tuesday, Trump criticized India for its high tariffs. “India is probably the highest tariff nation in the world,” he said. Ahead of his trip, negotiators from the two sides wrangled for months to narrow differences on farm goods, medical devices, digital trade and new tariffs.
