This comes a day after it said four jihadists were killed in a similar attack. The United States Africa Command (Africom) says it does not believe any civilians were injured in the attacks, although it is aware of reports on social media of civilian casualties. Over the weekend, an al-Shabab commander who had co-ordinated attacks on military targets was said to have been killed in another airstrike. These attacks by the US military have become increasingly common under Donald Trump's presidency, but they are often followed by reports from inside Somalia that civilians have been hit.
