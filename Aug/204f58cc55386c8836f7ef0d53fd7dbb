Not even the lure of the year's first major championship, to be played at San Francisco's TPC Harding Park without spectators starting on Thursday, was enough to convince Daly to return to action. He joins a number of high-profile golfers, including world No 1 Lee Westwood and 2018 Open champion Francesco Molinari, in deciding to not to play. Daly, 54, took to social media to explain his reasons, which included a fear of contracting the virus as a high-risk diabetic. "People keep asking why I (withdrew) from PGA???," Daly said on Twitter. "California now #1 in cases/deaths, I had knee surgery, I am a diabetic & I donâ€™t feel comfortable flying. Being too close proximity to even small crowds & risk exposure with my health not worth it!" Daly's two major wins include the 1991 PGA Championship and 1995 Open Championship. --News24--
