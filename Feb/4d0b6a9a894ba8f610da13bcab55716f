Investors were cautious as the United States (US) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urged Americans to prepare for the virus to spread in the US. 

President Donald Trump said he will hold a news conference on the coronavirus at 6 p.m. ET (2300 GMT). As of Wednesday, death toll in Italy had crossed 19 and new cases in South Korea rose above 1.260, while Greece and Brazil reported their first cases of the virus. “It’s unclear if it’s something that will be resolved in weeks or months or a longer time,” said Chester Spatt, professor of finance at Carnegie Mellon University. “There is potential for shock to both supply and demand sides of the economy. The magnitude of the shock is uncertain right now.” All major S&P sectors were trading higher, with technology leading the charge on a 1.6% gain. Defensive utilities, real estate and consumer staples were the laggards.
