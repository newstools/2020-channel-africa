The match will further Pakistan's efforts to host Test cricket, which returned to the country just two months ago after a 10-year gap with a series against Sri Lanka. International cricket was suspended in Pakistan after a militant attack on the Sri Lankan team bus in Lahore in March 2009, forcing them to play home fixtures in the United Arab Emirates. With improved security, Pakistan hosted limited-overs internationals between 2015-19 before security confidence improved. Bangladesh, initially reluctant to make a lengthy stay in Pakistan, only agreed to tour in three phases, having played Twenty20s in January. After this Test they head home, before returning to play a one-day international (April 3) and second Test (April 5-9) - both in Karachi. Azhar said the split series will give Pakistan further opportunity to establish itself as a Test host nation. "Credit to the two Boards for making this series possible," Azhar told reporters. "Would have been good if the series was not split but we are focused as this is a World Test Championship match." Pakistan are currently fourth in the championship, which features the top nine Test nations and is currently led by world number one India (360 points) followed by Australia (296) and England (146). The top two teams will play the final in June 2021. "Hosting matches in Pakistan will send a strong message that we are a safe country," said Azhar.
