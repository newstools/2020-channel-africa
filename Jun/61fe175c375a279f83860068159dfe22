A few principals have written an open letter to President Cyril Ramaphosa urging him to rethink the decision to open schools. They say that virus cases within the community are now affecting pupils and teachers. According to the Western Cape Education Department, over 300 staff members and 61 pupils had tested positive for coronavirus. Some teachers refused to report back to work after colleagues tested positive for the virus, Eye Witness News reports. The Western Cape is the worst-hit province in the country, with almost 50% of South Africa's cases. --BBC-
