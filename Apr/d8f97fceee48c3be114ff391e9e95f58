A statement from the Prime Minister's office said other officials who will give up their salaries are leaders of national institutions and top government officials. The East African nation has so far recorded 104 Covid-19 cases. The government has started distributing food to citizens who had been relying on receiving pay every day. They have been affected by rigid restrictions imposed during a lockdown that is due to end on 19 April. Some concerns have been raised about the food distribution programme, with some citizens saying that they were given too little to last them a day, while some officials have been jailed for theft. Last week, the International Monetary Fund approved a $109 million loan to Rwanda to help tackle the spread of coronavirus. --BBC--
