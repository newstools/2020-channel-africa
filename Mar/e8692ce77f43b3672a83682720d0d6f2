Details about what happened in Manguzi town are still sketchy. Mozambican authorities say the only people now allowed to pass through the Ponta D'Ouro border post are people who live in the immediate vicinity, such as Mozambican children who attend schools across the border in South Africa's KwaZulu-Natal province. "The riots have been taking place 10km Â from the border post," a spokesperson for Mozambican immigration told the BBC. "The head of the Ponta D'Ouro border post tried to hold a meeting with our South African counterparts. But they were not available on the ground", he added. Mozambican authorities are advising people to avoid using the border crossing "until the situation is normalised".
