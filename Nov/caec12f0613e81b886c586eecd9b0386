Al Sir Khalid said that as many as 20 000 refugees could cross the border this week. He said that some of the refugees had walked for two or three days to escape "bombardment", and that some of them were Ethiopian soldiers. Khalid said that the border centre had been overwhelmed and he was "very worried about the situation". The response is very slow, viable life-saving services are not there: no food, no shelter. The centre there can accommodate only 300 persons" He said NGOs and humanitarian organisations had responded to the refugee needs but more needed to be done. He praised the kindness of local villagers who had come out to help the refugees. Whenever there are newcomers, the Sudanese are the first to go and help. Farmers and local citizens, they share what they have: food, latrines and accommodated some of them, but their capacity is limited because they are poor people." Last week, Ethiopia's Prime Minister, Abiy Ahmed announced a military operation against the regional government of Tigray, accusing it of treason after its fighters seized a command centre hosting federal troops. Abiy, the winner of last year's Nobel Peace Prize, has sought to allay fears expressed by neighbouring countries that the operation could spill over beyond Ethiopian borders. --BBC--
