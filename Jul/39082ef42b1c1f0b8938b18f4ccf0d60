The firm, hit by a 62% fall in sales in its most recent quarter, said the reductions were necessary "given the uncertainties" of the virus impact. However, Levi's said shoppers are returning as stores reopen. But it warned that it expected sales to be "significantly adversely impacted" through the end of this year. "There are still a lot of uncertainties," said Levi's Chief Executive Chip Bergh. Levi's, which re-listed on the US stock exchange in 2019, has seen sales rise in recent years, as jeans regained popularity and the fad for loungewear faded. But those trends were reversed in the lockdown months, as shoppers cut spending on clothing, especially pants. Levi's reported a loss of $364 million the three months to May 24, compared to a profit of $29 million in the same period in 2019. --BBC--
