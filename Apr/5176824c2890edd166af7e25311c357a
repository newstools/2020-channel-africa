Trump referred to the "Invisible Enemy", a phrase he has used to describe the virus that has killed more than 42 000 people in the US, which has more than 766 660 infections. "In light of the attack from the Invisible Enemy, as well as the need to protect the jobs of our GREAT American Citizens, I will be signing an Executive Order to temporarily suspend immigration into the United States!" he tweeted Monday night. The State Department issued around 462 000 immigrant visas in the 2019 fiscal year, while US Citizens and Immigration Services granted permanent residence to nearly 577 000 individuals. --AFP--
