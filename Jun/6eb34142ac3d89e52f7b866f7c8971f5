An F1 statement said the championship would begin across three consecutive weekends, two in Austria on July 5 and 12 and a third in Hungary. There will then be a two-week break before two consecutive races in Britain and events in Spain, Belgium and Italy. All will be run behind closed doors with participants following guidelines to minimise the spread of COVID-19. The British Grands Prix at Silverstone will be held August 9 and 12, followed immediately by the Spanish Grand Prix at Barcelona on August 16. The Belgian and Italian Grands Prix will complete the European part of the season on their original dates of August 30 and September 6. Plans for the remainder of the season were not announced, because of the uncertainty of the coronavirus situation in the various countries that would have made up the original schedule. However, F1 said it had "an expectation of having a total of 15-18 races before we complete our season in December". It is understood that F1 is highly confident of finishing the championship with races in Bahrain on December 6 and Abu Dhabi on December 13. Before that, the low incidence of coronavirus in China, Vietnam and Japan makes races in those countries a strong probability in October. The Russian Grand Prix, which is pencilled in for after the European events along with the race in Azerbaijan, and those in the United States, Mexico and Brazil are more uncertain because of the high rates of infection in those countries. --BBC--
