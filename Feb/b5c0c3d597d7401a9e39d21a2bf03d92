The trio were among the 35 graduates, who successfully secured their Asian Tour cards after finishing inside the Top 35 and ties. Zimbabwe's Benjamin Follett-Smith finished top of his class with a one-shot victory at the Lake View Resort and Golf Club in Thailand. Ahlers and Schietekat finished tied for fifth at 11-under par - four shots behind Follett-Smith. For Ahlers, this will be his second season playing on the Asian Tour. "It's nice to have another tour to play on, I enjoyed it when I played in Asia in the 2010s," said Ahlers after his final round. "I feel like I could play well around here, I don't mind the heat so I'm pretty happy." Meanwhile, Schietekat stated earlier in the week that he'd like to replicate fellow countryman Justin Harding's success in Asia. "I have played a little bit on the Asian Tour last season on a couple invites. It was nice and I kind of got used to the grass so it's not that unfamiliar to me," said Schietekat, who is a three-time Sunshine Tour winner.
