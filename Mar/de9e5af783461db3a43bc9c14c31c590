Only the world's top 50 are invited to the event, which has been put back from April until October in Augusta, and the 2010 US Open champion currently sits in 49 place in the frozen rankings. However, the Northern Irishman fears a change in the qualification rules could yet mean he misses out amid uncertainty over the rescheduling of the golf calendar. Speaking on a PGA Tour conference call, McDowell said: "I'd be very happy if the Masters are going to honour the current qualification as it would be if their tournament was to be held two weeks from now, obviously, because I'd be eligible for it. "But there's so many ifs and buts. Will it be played? If so, when? This year? How will the eligibility be governed? "It's so tough. It's so difficult to know. It's nice to be sitting in the top 50, but when I look at it in real terms, the Players, the World Matchplay, they both had to be played before the cut-off. "If we had continued to play golf, would I have earned that position? Maybe I wouldn't have. Selfishly, I hope they acknowledge the rankings as we sit when it comes time to play. "But there's so many bigger picture things that need to happen between now and then. We'll just have to wait and see because you know about as much as I do.
