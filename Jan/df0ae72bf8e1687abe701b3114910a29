It may be too late to salvage City's defence of the Premier League title as they remain 14 points behind runaway leaders Liverpool, who also have a game in hand, but led by Aguero the champions moved ahead of Leicester into second to show they will not give up the chase. Aguero eclipsed Thierry Henry's record as the top scoring non-English player in the Premier League by taking his tally to 177 goals and also surpassed Alan Shearer's league record for hat-tricks with his 12th since joining City from Atletico Madrid in 2011. "He was a legend and the legend rises tonight," said Guardiola. "He is one of the most incredible players I've seen in this league. To score this amount of goals and hat-tricks means you have done for many, many years a lot of good things. You have to be consistent for many years so it's an incredible compliment to him." Guardiola could afford the luxury of recalling Aguero among six changes to the side that also outclassed Manchester United in midweek to put one foot in the League Cup final. --News24--
