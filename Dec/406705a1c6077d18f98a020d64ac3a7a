The Briton, 35, sealed a seventh drivers' title at the Turkish Grand Prix in November - equalling Michael Schumacher's championships record. Rugby league legend Rob Burrow is made an MBE for services to rugby and his awareness campaign since being diagnosed with motor neurone disease. British Billie Jean King Cup captain Anne Keothavong also becomes an MBE. The former British number one, 37, represented Great Britain in the event - previously known as the Fed Cup - before becoming captain in 2016. Others made an MBE include former Tottenham and Chelsea striker Jimmy Greaves and ex-Wolves midfielder Ron Flowers, both World Cup winners with England in 1966. Greaves, who later became a popular television personality, suffered a severe stroke in 2015 and his son Danny said of the MBE: "We are very, very proud of Dad. Always have been, always will be. "At almost 81 to receive an honour from Her Majesty the Queen is just something very, very special." Following rugby union side Exeter Chiefs' domestic and European titles last season, director of rugby Rob Baxter is made an OBE while captain Joe Simmonds becomes an MBE. "I couldn't quite work out if it was real or whether it was spam or someone having bit of a prank," Baxter said of the moment he received the news. "It turned up by email and not in an official letter. You download it, read it and check who it has been emailed from with a Google search. "I was sat there with my wife, both of us in a slightly bemused state. My family are delighted." Former England captain Gillian Coultard has been appointed an MBE for services to football, along with former Swansea City and Wales forward Alan Curtis.
