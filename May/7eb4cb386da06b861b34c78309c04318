At the start of May 2020 the company described government's decision to continue the ban on the sale of tobacco products under level 4 restrictions as "bizarre and irregular". "We have taken the decision not to pursue legal action at this stage but, instead, to pursue further discussions with government on the formulation and application of the regulations under the Covid-19 lockdown," it said in a statement. BATSA said it has received a response to a letter sent at the end of April to the National Command Council, and was "convinced that by working together we can find a better solution that works for all South Africans and removes the threat of criminal sanction from 11 million tobacco consumers in the country". The tobacco company, which has 78% share in South Africa's legal cigarette market, did not say what the letter said. The ban on the sale of cigarette and tobacco products was first instituted on March 26 when the nationwide lockdown commenced.Â 

The prohibition continued under level 4 of the lockdown which has been in place since the start of May.
