In an interview with South Korean newspaper, Chosun Ilbo, published on Sunday, Trevor Milton, founder of Nikola Corp, said he would like to co-operate with Hyundai. He said he had twice made proposals to Hyundai that were rejected. Hyundai, along with Toyota Motor Corp are among the few automakers championing hydrogen technology. “Trevor has immense respect for Hyundai and views Hyundai amongst the leaders in hydrogen around the world,” Nikola spokesperson Nicole Rose said in an emailed statement to Reuters. “Trevor has, and will continue to be, open to collaborate if they ever choose to do so,” Rose said. She did not address queries on whether Nikola had made proposals to Hyundai. A person familiar with Hyundai said that there are no current cooperation talks between the two companies. “If Nikola makes an official offer, Hyundai can consider the proposal,” the person said. He said that Hyundai wants to sell its hydrogen systems to other automakers, but at the same time, Nikola could become a potential competitor to Hyundai’s commercial truck business. “It would be a complicated relationship,” he said, declining to be identified because he is not authorised to speak to the media. --Reuters--
