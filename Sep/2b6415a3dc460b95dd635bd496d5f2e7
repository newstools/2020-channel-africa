Zverev who had not played on clay since last year, trailed 4-1 in the opening set before he turned the screw on Court Philippe Chatrier, whose roof remained open despite a light drizzle. “Close the roof!” screamed one of the few spectators during the second set. It made Zverev smile but did not affect the German’s focus as he set up a meeting with either France’s Pierre-Hugues Herbert or American qualifier Michael Mmoh. “I didn’t play any claycourt before this, it’s my first one this year and it was not easy. It was rainy and cold, I needed to get used to it, said the 23-year-old Zverev. “He’s a player who is good on this surface. He grew up with fellow Austrian Dominic Thiem. All they did was play on this surface.” Addressing his critics, Zverev added: “Some say that I don’t do well at Grand Slams, I’m proving them wrong this year. I’m hoping for a deep run here.” Zverev, who never made it past the last-eight at Roland Garros, reached the semi-finals at the Australian Open before losing to Thiem in the US Open final earlier this month. --Reuters--
