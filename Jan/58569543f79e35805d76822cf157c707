Jamaica started out well and despite a final quarter fight back, the Proteas weren’t able to catch up. Coach Dorette Badenhorst says they need to deal with the loss and prepare for an even tougher next match, against England on Wednesday. “Not the best start that we wanted, quite disappointing. But we will go back and really work hard to beat England and New Zealand to stay in that final. Well done to Jamaica, they really played well to beat us on speed." 

"But  it’s all about trust and believing in each other and just believing in those new combinations. I believe we can do well in this competition and we’ll just come back stronger, says Badenhorst.
