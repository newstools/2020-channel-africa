Warner suffered the injury during a one-day international on November 29. Australia says he could return for the second test, beginning on December 26. It leaves the hosts with issues at the top of the order for the first test, starting on December 17. On Tuesday, opener Will Pucovski retired hurt after being hit on the head by a bouncer. Uncapped Pucovski, who has a history of concussion problems, was struck by a Kartik Tyagi delivery while playing for Australia A against the Indians. Joe Burns is the only other recognised opener in the test squad, meaning Australia may have to draft in reinforcements, or promote Marnus Labuschagne for the day-night test at the Adelaide Oval, which is the first of four in the series. --BBC--
