The pandemic is decreasing women’s access to sexual and reproductive health care worldwide as supply chains are disrupted, transport is restricted and services deemed “non-essential” are shut down, said the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health think tank, in a report. Just a 10% decline in access to care in low- and middle-income countries would result in an additional 15 million unintended pregnancies, 28 000 maternal deaths and 3 million unsafe abortions, the study showed. That is a conservative estimate for what might happen in reality, with some experts predicting a decline of up to 80%, said Elizabeth Sully, senior research scientist at Guttmacher. “There’s a lot to suggest that we could see this and we could see something worse,” Sully told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. “We need to take action now in a preventative way before we start to see these types of impacts.” Countries should make sure sexual and reproductive health services are essential and staffed, make contraceptives available without a prescription and explore innovative models of care such as telemedicine, the report recommended. The International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) reported last week that more than 5600 of its clinics and care providers - representing 14% of the total - had closed because of the outbreak across 64 countries. Countries particularly affected by closures included Pakistan, El Salvador, Zambia, Sudan, Colombia, Malaysia, Uganda, Ghana, Germany, Zimbabwe and Sri Lanka, said IPPF. --Reuters--
