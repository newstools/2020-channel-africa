In just four months, it happened 60 times. When COVID-19 shut South Africa’s mines, workers from Jele’s homeland eSwatini and other neighbouring nations rushed home - disrupting TB care for thousands of miners at high risk from the disease due to weakened lungs after years working underground. Jele - secretary general of a migrant mineworkers’ association in eSwatini - said more lives could now be lost to TB as overstretched healthcare systems prioritise COVID-19. “There’s such a strong focus on COVID that everyone is forgetting about TB and other non-communicable diseases, and this contributes to more deaths,” Jele said by phone from the landlocked kingdom, where TB treatment is not always available. Patients who do not consistently take the full course of several months’ medication can spread drug-resistant tuberculosis, which is TB that is resistant to common medications, according to the World Bank. Home to the world’s third-largest mining industry, South Africa draws about 45 000 mineworkers from surrounding countries such as Botswana, eSwatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia and Zimbabwe, making up about 10% of the workforce.  

It is both an economy booster and a TB hotspot due to enclosed, dusty working conditions underground, said Cleopas Sibanda, programme manager for the Wits Health Consortium, a health research unit in Johannesburg.
