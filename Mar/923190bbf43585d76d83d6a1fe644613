The 26-year-old man had been referred to Wilkins Hospital in the capital, Harare, earlier this week with a fever. He arrived in Zimbabwe on February 14 from Thailand and had been described as low-risk. The ministry said the man has since been discharged from hospital. Zimbabwe has no confirmed case of coronavirus.
