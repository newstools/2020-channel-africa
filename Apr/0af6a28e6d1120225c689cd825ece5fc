"This really is a time when not just the G20 countries but other international partners and financial institutions need to practically demonstrate their commitment to supporting developing economies in Africa and around the world," Ramaphosa wrote in his weekly newsletter.

"In the last week, I have had useful discussions with a number of world leaders, including the UN Secretary-General, EU Commission President and the leaders of France, Russia and Cuba. As South Africa, we continue to receive practical support from countries like the United States, China, Cuba and Russia." Ramaphosa, the current chairman of the African Union (AU), said given the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the continent to date, billions of dollars may be needed to bolster fragile economies further battered by the health crisis. "Africa cannot do this alone... Given the substantial toll this pandemic is already taking on African economies, the assistance that will be needed could run into billions of dollars." He said as an immediate priority, Africa needed more medical supplies, including Covid-19 test kits. "Africa is facing a severe shortage of coronavirus test kits, medicines, face masks and other personal protection equipment." The AU was working with the World Health Organisation (WHO), the Africa Centre for Disease Control and world leaders to not only mobilise international support to bring vital supplies to the continent, but also to increase production of what is required in African states. The AU Bureau has proposed a number of measures to bring economic relief to Africa, including a comprehensive stimulus package for the continent, with debt relief in the form of interest payment waivers and deferred payments. "This would free up much-needed financial resources now that national budgets are being reprioritised to support the coronavirus response," Ramaphosa said. --ANA--
