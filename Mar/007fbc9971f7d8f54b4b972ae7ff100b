The call was made by World Health Organisation Director-General, Tedros Ghebreyesus, during the press briefing on the global status of Covid-19. Ghebreyesus says while the world is currently plagued with the ongoing Covid-19 outbreak, Tuberculosis could make more people vulnerable to Covid-19. World Tuberculosis Day is celebrated to raise public awareness about the devastating health, social and economic consequences of TB, and to step up efforts to end the global TB epidemic. The theme in 2020 is "It is time". The theme is a call for accelerated action to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal targets to end TB epidemics by 2030.
