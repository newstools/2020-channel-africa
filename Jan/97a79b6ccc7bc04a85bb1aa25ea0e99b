Parts of Africa have experienced heavy rain in recent months because the Indian Ocean is warmer than usual, partly as result of a cyclical weather phenomenon and partly because oceans are warming everywhere. Floods, landslides and a cyclone killed more than 1200 people across East and Southern Africa in 2019, according to a Save the Children count based on United Nations (UN) and government figures. Flooding also displaced nearly half a million people in Southern Sudan, 200 000 in Ethiopia and at least 370 000 in Somalia in 2019, the UN said.
