Mohamed Shaker added in a statement that the joint co-operation between the two sides in the field of electricity and renewable energy, in addition to increasing the volume of joint projects implemented by Egyptian companies working in the field of electricity will be discussed.

This came during Shaker’s visit to Congo on Sunday, heading a high-level delegation that includes a number of leaders of the electricity sector, a number of Egyptian officials and private sector companies working in the field of electricity.

Shaker added that ways to facilitate Egyptian participation in the Inga Dam project will also be discussed. He confirmed the Egyptian side’s keenness to have a role in implementing the project through the Egyptian private sector companies and with the support of the Egyptian Government through the two countries' political declaration, which came during the visit of Congolese prime minister and Congo’s energy minister to Egypt in 2016.

Shaker affirmed that the Egyptian Government supports the Democratic Republic of Congo in all fields, including the electricity field, and that all the potentials of the Egyptian electricity sector are available to serve the electricity sector on its land.

Such a visit asserts President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi and the Egyptian political leadership's keenness to strengthen cooperation with African countries and enhance the Egyptian presence there. It also aims to activate the Egyptian Government's policy in the electricity and renewable energy sector to support and enhance co-operation with African countries to achieve benefit for all parties and benefit from the huge hydroelectric potential of the continent. --EgyptToday--
