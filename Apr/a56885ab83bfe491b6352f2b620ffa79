The court was due to rule on Wednesday on whether to extend an existing injunction against the lockdown. That legal action was brought by Human Rights Defenders Coalition, who had warned the poor were at greatest risk since no food rations were being offered by the government. Religious groups also sought an injunction of their own, saying the lockdown was a violation of religious freedom. The court has now ruled that the planned lockdown must wait until a higher court, the Supreme Court, makes a ruling on several constitutional questions that have arisen during the pandemic. Malawi has recorded 36 cases of coronavirus, including three deaths. --BBC--
