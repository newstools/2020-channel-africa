According to Sky Italy the Premier League club are open to offers for Anguissa and that Milan are among possible suitors for the Cameroon international. The 24-year-old joined Fulham from Marseille in 2018 but spent last season on-loan at Villarreal where he scored two goals in 36 LaLiga appearances for the Spanish club. Milan have been targeting Arsenal’s Lucas Torreira and Chelsea’s Tiemoue Bakayoko, but Anguissa has been earmarked as another potential target according to the report. The Serie A club already boast a strong African midfield core with Ivory Coast’s Franck Kessie and Algeria’s Ismaël Bennacer having both started the Rossoneri’s 2-0 win over Bologna on Monday. Anguissa featured in both of Fulham’s Premier League games this season, playing the full 90 minutes in a 4-3 defeat to Leeds United this past weekend. --AllAfrica--
