John Nkengasong told the BBC's Newsday programme that the tests will give a clearer picture of who has been exposed to the virus and to what extent. He said antibody testing will allow the continent to coordinate efforts to combat the pandemic. "We fully understand that we should focus on those who are actively infected but it is also important to public health to understand where the spread is, so that you can design appropriate intervention measures in those communities and in the population as a whole," he said. The testing he said will provide guidance once vaccination begins to determine who is eligible and who needs the vaccine. --BBC--
