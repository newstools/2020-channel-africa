In a first step, many of Sonangol’s non-core businesses will be earmarked for privatisation, after which the rest of the core company would be overhauled, he said. “Once we finished that process, there will be the conditions for bringing Sonangol to the stock exchange,” Azevedo said on the sidelines of a briefing at think tank Chatham House. “Sonangol is like an octopus, it’s everywhere, there are properties everywhere, in Portugal, here, Singapore, aviation, resorts, hotels,” he added. Azevedo said the government had hired Deloitte to help with the process. --Reuters--
