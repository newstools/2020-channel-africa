The killings come as communal violence and ethnic-related attacks continue to pose challenges for the government of Nobel Peace Prize-winning Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed. His office has shared condolences with 10 victims' families, but the exact number of fatalities is hard to verify. Activists say there could be more than 100 dead. Oromia's regional government released a statement calling what happened on Sunday a "terror act". A spokesperson told the BBC a team had been sent to Guliso district, the location of the violence, to investigate, anticipating the death toll could be "high". Government-run media in Amhara, the second-most populous state in Ethiopia, reported that the perpetrators rounded up about 200 people before the attack. Dozens of houses were also set on fire, it said. In the past two months, scores of civilians have been killed in at least three of Ethiopiaâ€™s 10 states in attacks or ethnic-related violence. --BBC--
