President Buhari said the suspension of Ibrahim Magu is an indication that Nigeria's fight against corruption is "real and active", according to a statement released through a spokesperson, Speaking of the importance of accountability and transparency, President Buhari said Nigerians must realise that they will be held accountable. He said the suspension of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission boss will enable the anti-corruption agency to continue its work, "without the cloud of an investigation...over its head". Magu was arrested on Monday following allegations of abuse of office. He is accused of stealing money that his anti-corruption agency had confiscated during its operations. The authorities had previously denied his arrest. The investigation is ongoing but local media reports that Magu has denied all the allegations. President Buhari said Magu is being given the opportunity to defend himself and respond to all the allegations against him. Fighting corruption was one of President Buhariâ€™s main campaign promises during both the 2015 and 2019 elections. But critics say more high-profile convictions are needed. --BBC--
