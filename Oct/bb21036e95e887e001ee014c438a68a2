In a lengthy communique, G20 finance ministers and central bank governors also agreed in principle for the first time on a “Common Framework” to deal on a case-by-case basis with the rising number of low-income countries facing debt distress. The Paris Club of official creditors also backs the framework. The move marks a significant step forward for China, which has become a major creditor to poor countries in recent years but had balked at the prospect of writing off any debts, according to sources familiar with the G20 deliberations. G20 officials also agreed - as expected - to extend by six months the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI) that freezes official bilateral debt payments until year-end, and said they would consider another six-month extension in April. “The common framework is a historic achievement and a major breakthrough in the international debt agenda,” Mohammed al-Jadaan, finance minister of current G20 chair Saudi Arabia, told an online news conference during the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. “It facilitates timely and orderly debt treatment for DSSI-eligible countries, with participation of broad creditors, including the private sector,” he said. United States (US) Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin urged G20 members to quickly endorse the framework, saying it would ease “debt write-downs when needed, help promote debt sustainability, and support policy reforms” in low-income countries with high debt burdens.
