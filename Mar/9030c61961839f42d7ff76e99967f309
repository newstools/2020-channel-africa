A Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) team "arrived this morning and will join Sudanese investigators", Faisal Mohammed Saleh told journalists. Sudan's post-uprising leader Hamdok escaped unharmed on Monday after an assassination attempt using explosives targeted his convoy in the capital, Khartoum. The American investigators will bring relevant "expertise and techniques for this kind of case", Saleh said. The United States team comprises three people, local media cited the interior ministry as saying. 

Sudan's Security and Defence council met on Monday evening and called for foreign assistance. There has been no claim of responsibility for the attack. Sudanese authorities have made several arrests, including of foreigners, Saleh said, without giving further detail. On Tuesday, the interior ministry said the blast was caused by an improvised explosive device placed on the route taken by Hamdok's convoy.
