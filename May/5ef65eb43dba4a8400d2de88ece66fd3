At least four inmates have tested positive and many more are quarantined in Ndolo prison in the capital city, Kinshasa. The overcrowded prison is hosting inmates at nearly four times its capacity. Human rights organisations are concerned the virus could easily spread among prisoners and to the relatives who visit them. Rights groups are asking for the release of prisoners accused or convicted of petty crimes to ease overcrowding. DRC has confirmed cases of the new coronavirus in at least seven provinces, but the majority of the cases have been concentrated in Kinshasa. Meanwhile, the Africa Centre for Disease Control (CDC) has outlined some of the trials going on for Covid-19 treatment and vaccination in Africa. Fifty-two countries have currently reported positive cases of the virus, with more than 37 000 patients being treated. In a joint briefing online with doctors at Shanghai hospital, the Africa CDC said that in comparison to the rest of the world there were very few treatments happening on the continent. In Egypt, there are about 13 trials going on looking specifically at therapeutics. In Zambia, they have one ongoing trial with hydroxychloroquine. South Africa is part of the World Health Organisation solidarity trial and they are looking at Chloroquine, Interferon, Remdesivir. In Nigeria, there is one trial in progress.
