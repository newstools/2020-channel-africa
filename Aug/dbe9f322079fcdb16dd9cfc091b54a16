Amazon Pharmacy will make its debut in Bangalore and it may be trialled in other Indian cities. The move comes as the online drugs business has been given a major boost during the coronavirus pandemic. This year United States (US) technology giants have invested billions of dollars in the Indian economy. The Amazon Pharmacy service offers prescription, over-the-counter and traditional Ayurveda medication as well as basic health devices. â€œThis is particularly relevant in present times as it will help customers meet their essential needs while staying safe at home," an Amazon spokesperson said. Amazon started its move into pharmaceutical retailing in 2017. The following year it bought US-based home delivery medications start up PillPack. At the end of last year, the company introduced its Amazon Pharmacy branding to PillPack's service. In January, Amazon filed to trademark the name Amazon Pharmacy in the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada. The move was seen as a sign that the company was set to significantly expand its prescription drugs business outside of the US. --BBC--
