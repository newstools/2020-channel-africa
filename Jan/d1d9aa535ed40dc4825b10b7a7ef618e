His comments to the United States leader, made recently at a World Economic Forum event in Davos, Switzerland, sparked a heated debated and divided opinions. In a statement released by his foundation, Motsepe said the outcry had exposed him to the views of Africans who disagreed with his remarks. I have a duty to listen to these differing views and would like to apologise. I do not have the right to speak on behalf of anybody except myself. As a global philanthropist and business leader, I have for many decades worked to bring together and unite people of different races, ethnic groups and members of different religious and faith-based organisations. I’ve worked with political, business, societal and other leaders whose views and policies I do not share and will continue to do so in Africa and globally. My remarks at the dinner with President Donald Trump were partly aimed at encouraging discussions between the Trump administration and African political and business leaders, particularly in the context of the increasing feedback from certain American political and business leaders that South Africa and some African countries are anti-America and its political leadership." He pointed to the challenges facing Africa with the world’s fastest-growing population and large unemployment rates. Africa has to create approximately eight million new jobs for the youth every year and South Africa has to create in excess of 500 000 new jobs for the youth each year. In order to do this and to provide skills and expertise and improve the living conditions and standards of living of millions of Africans, Africa will have to create partnerships and increase trade and investment ties between Africa and America and between Africa and other parts of the world." The 58-year-old said it was his aim to contribute to building beneficial ties between the “economies and people of Africa and America and Africa and the world”. --BBC--
