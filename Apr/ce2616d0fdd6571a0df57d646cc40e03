Flight to safety left the local unit firmly on the back foot – shedding roughly 2 percent of its value during a choppy European session – as the trade-weighted US dollar rose against a basket of currencies. 

A decisive breach through the key echelon and incoming hard data to confirm the severity of the Covid-19 pandemic on the global economy set the scene for a race towards the R20/$ barrier. 

At the close of local trade, the rand quoted 1.96 percent weaker at R18.48/$, after trading in range of R18.09/$ - R18.66/$. Meanwhile, the rand remained on the back foot this morning. 

Expected range today R18.30/$ - R18.80/$.
