Five French-language weekly newspapers and seven Arab dailies have been suspended for at least three months. The authorities said the publications had failed to meet requirements that senior staff were trained in journalism and had at least three years' higher education. Chad's Human Rights League described the suspension as a "shame" for the country. --BBC--
