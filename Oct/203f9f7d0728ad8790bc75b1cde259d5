Kim’s triumph at Aronimink Golf Course after a scintillating final round 63 put paid to her status as the most prolific winner on the LPGA Tour among active players never to have won a major title. “I’m so excited. I’m really hiding my tears at the moment. It was amazing that I really won it. So I’m very happy and excited that I got it done,” the 27-year-old South Korean said, beaming next to the winner’s trophy. Seven-times major champion Park had beaten Kim for the 2015 title at Westchester Country Club and was only three strokes behind her compatriot going into the final round. A five-under round might get the job done, she thought. Park duly delivered with a 65 but it was not enough as overnight leader Kim rose to the challenge with her seven-under-par 63. “Obviously Sei-young was just much better than anyone else out there today,” said Park, who had been chasing a fourth win in the event. --Reuters--
