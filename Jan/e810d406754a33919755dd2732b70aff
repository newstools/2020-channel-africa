Embalo, 47, won with 54% of Sunday’s vote, the commission said, versus 46% for another ex-prime minister and ruling party candidate Domingos Simoes Pereira in the poll to succeed incumbent President Jose Mario Vaz. Vaz’s tenure was marred by political infighting, an ill-functioning parliament and corruption. If Pereira’s challenge fails, Embalo, who served as prime minister under Vaz from 2016-18, faces the difficult task of overcoming a long-running political impasse and modernizing the West African nation of 1.6 million people. Guinea Bissau has seen nine coups or attempted coups since independence from Portugal in 1974. “I call for union, reconciliation and concord for a peaceful life in Guinea Bissau,” Embalo told a press conference on Wednesday in which he also promised to revive the education and energy sectors. “We must believe in ourselves and put ourselves to work to create wealth and develop the country.” However, Pereira’s complaint looks set to extend the political chaos that has dogged the tiny ocean-side country in recent years and made voters weary of the political class. The 56-year-old, who easily won a November first round, told supporters that in some polling stations votes surpassed the number of enrolled voters and he would file a complaint to the Supreme Court.
