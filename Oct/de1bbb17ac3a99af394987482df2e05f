The operations through Namdeb only recorded 242 000 carats worth of diamonds recovered over the aforementioned period, way below the normal average of 300 000 carats per quarter.

The 242 000 carats were split between 147 000 from Debmarine and 95 000 from Namdeb's land operations. Last year, the same quarter brought in 426 000 carats with Debmarine at 320 000 and land operations at 106 000.

Botswana operations were also not stellar. They recorded a yearly decrease of 15%, while in South Africa and Canada, production rose by 120% and 17%, respectively.

Released figures indicate Debmarine was responsible for the low production in Namibia, due to vessels which were suspended from operations, awaiting maintenance.

The 147 000 carats is the lowest Debmarine has ever produced in the last seven years, data analysed by The Namibian shows.

On average, Debmarine's production is at least three times more than that of land operations.

For the third quarter, however, land operations brought in some 95 000 carats, increasing quarter-on-quarter by 79% from 53 000 carats, decreasing by 10% year-on-year.

South Africa's 120% production increase closed the quarter with 1.1 million carats recovered, while Canada recovered 915 000 carats, a 17% uptick.

Last year, South Africa had a recovery of 535Â 000 carats, while Canada was at 779 000 carats. Bostwana was still the biggest contributor to production, adding 4.8 million carats.

Production to date stands at 18.4 million carats, 20% lower than 22.9 million carats recovered over the same cumulative period last year.

De Beers blames this drop on a lower demand for rough diamonds due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but maintains that budgeted yearly recovery will be kept at between 25 and 27 million carats.

The results as above were announced by Anglo American, De Beers' parent company, whose Chief Executive Officer, Mark Cutifani, says the improvement in the demand for rough diamonds as the holiday season approaches is encouraging, although there is still some uncertainty in terms of the timing of a sustained recovery. --TheNamibian--
