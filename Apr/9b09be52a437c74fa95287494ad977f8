The body, whose flagship event the US PGA Championship has been postponed from May amid the shelter-in-place policies designed to slow spread of the virus, pledged to match up to an additional $2.5 million given by other groups. A statement said the PGA of America contribution included all members of its executive team voluntarily reducing their compensation. The board of directors pledged personal donations. "There's pain everywhere," PGA Chief Executive Seth Waugh said. "It's how to get to the other side. The government is doing extraordinary things. The Fed actions last week were stunning. The loan programs are very clever to keep people employed. The bad news is it may not be enough depending on how long this lasts. What we're saying is, 'How can we create an additional safety net?'" The fund will be administered by E4E Relief, an independent public charity. The PGA, which represents club professionals, has nearly 29 000 members. But PGA president Suzy Whaley said it's hoped the fund will help members of other golf organisations, club caddies and players on developmental tours. "We have to ensure that the heart and soul of our game, our people, are able to get back on their feet and continue to serve others down the road," Whaley said. "Eventually, golf will return, but we first need to reach out and help people in our industry during this national emergency." --News24--
