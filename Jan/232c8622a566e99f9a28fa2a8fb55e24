The six belonged to the FDU-Inkingi party, formerly led by Victoire Ingabire, an outspoken critic of President Paul Kagame. Gatera Gashabana, the lawyer for the six, said they would appeal against their conviction and sentences. Ingabire herself served six years of a 15-year prison term on charges of conspiring to form an armed group to undermine the government, before being released in 2018. She said the charges were politically motivated. Human rights groups have long criticized the Rwandan governmentâ€™s intolerance of dissent under Kagame and mysterious murders and disappearances of some opposition critics. The government has denied such accusations. State-run Radio Rwanda, in a report late on Thursday, said the six newly sentenced to prison included Boniface Twagirimana, a vice president in the FDU-Inkingi, who along with one associate received a 10-year term.
