Sundowns have their work cut out for them in the second leg of their CAF Champions League quarter-final clash with the Egyptian giants after losing the first leg 2-0 in Cairo. Kekana, however, believes Masandawana have the quality to put The Club of the Century to the sword and to turn the deficit around at Lucas Moripe Stadium in Pretoria, South Africa. "We know very well that we didn't score in Egypt and it's something we want to rectify here at home. We created three chances that we should have scored," Kekana said, as quoted by SowetanLIVE. "I hope we don't get a stage-fright and try to give a good performance. I think one early goal can set the tone. We can't start slow in this match. We must come out strong. I would presume that they will come out very cautious on the day because they know that we will put them under pressure.‚Äù added Kekana. "We have to play our normal game when we are at home. It has worked out well for us because we have been able to kill off games early. When we score, we know that our next goal is coming." Kekana also committed himself to Sundowns this week by signing a new four-year contract, which he has described as an easy decision to make. "I have renewed my contract with Sundowns simply because I feel at home here. I have beautiful memories with the club, and I feel I should continue," Kekana added. "They have been good to me. I am happy because the fans love me, and it was an easy decision to make." --News24--
