It follows the postponement of the T20 World Cup, scheduled for October-November in Australia, and this month's one-day international series against Zimbabwe. Cricket Australia (CA) said the three-match West Indies series had been intended as a warm-up to the T20 World Cup, but could no longer serve that purpose. "In light of this development... it has been agreed to postpone the matches," CA said in a statement. The series will be take place ahead of the rescheduled T20 World Cup, on dates yet to be decided in either 2021 or 2022. Australia is currently struggling with a second wave of coronavirus infections and its international borders remain closed, with arrivals required to undergo 14-day quarantine. Despite the logistical difficulties, CA insists a money-spinning four-Test series against India in December-January will proceed. The governing body has been less vocal about the fate of the first-ever Test match between Australia and Afghanistan, which is due to be held in Perth in late November.
