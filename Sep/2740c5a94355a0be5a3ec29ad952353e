Brent crude LCOc1 was up 54 cents, or 1.3%, to $41.98 per barrel at 1033 GMT. United States (US) West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 for October, due to expire on Tuesday, rose 63 cents, or 1.6%, to $39.94. The more active November contract was up 45 cents, or 1.1%, to $39.99. Markets were nervous about fuel demand in countries such as Britain, where the government will tell people to work from home again and will impose new curbs on pubs, bars and restaurants. “As any new restrictions will likely be more localised, the oil demand recovery should still continue, although at a slower pace with the easiest demand gains behind us,” UBS oil analyst Giovanni Staunovo said. Monday’s price slump was spurred by concerns of an increase in coronavirus cases in major markets. France saw its infections rate rising, Italy introduced more mandatory testing, Spain asked the army for help and Germany describe the situation as worrying. “Losing $2 a barrel yesterday is quite a steep drop, so the market today is adjusting the impact to a bit higher price levels,” said Bjornar Tonhaugen, Rystad Energy’s head of oil markets.
