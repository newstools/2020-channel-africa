Standard Bank said ICBC Standard (ICBCS) reported a $248 million loss during the period, with a single client costing its $198 million while restructuring costs rising $30 million and operations $20 million. The group’s 40% share of the losses equated to R1.4 billion ($89 million). In September, Standard Bank recorded a $163 million impairment of its stake in ICBCS, reducing the carrying value from $383 million to $220 million. The group said this equated to a R2.4 billion ($150 million) impairment reported outside of headline earnings. As a result, the group reported a 1%. The group declared a 2% increase in dividend a share to 994c. Chief Executive, Sim Tshabalala, said the bank's performance during the period under review was nonetheless underpinned by the growth and resilience of its core operations. “The constrained macroeconomic environment, particularly in South Africa, and ICBCS losses impacted the group’s results,” Tshabalala said, adding that growth in the sub-Saharan Africa had been revised downwards. “Growth in South and Central Africa continued to be negatively impacted by the poor South African environment. In South Africa, load-shedding undermined growth prospects, the pace of policy progress and reform was slow and Eskom’s fiscal concerns remained unresolved.  

Business and consumer confidence levels remained low, constraining spending and demand for credit. The economy shrank 1.4% in the fourth quarter of 2019 which resulted in a second recession in less than two years. Real GDP growth for the year was 0.2%.” Standard Bank said credit impairment charges increased 23% to R7.96 billion ($510 million) off a low base and pushed South Africa’s second largest bank by market capitalisation credit loss ratio to 68 basis points from 56 points last year. The group said the ratio was expected to remain “at the lower end” of Standard Bank’s 70 to 100 basis points range. Return on equity declined to 16.8% from 18% a year earlier, and the bank said it would move closer to the lower end of its 18% to 20% goal in 2020. Personal and Business Banking increased its headline earnings by 6% to R16.5 billion ($1.05 billion) while Corporate and Investment Banking grew headline earnings by 5% to R11.8 billion ($750 million). Last year the bank reduced its headcount by 5.5% as it battled cost growth below inflation and revenue growth. Chief Executive of Customer Experience Specialists, Nathalie Schooling, said the bank would focus on increasing competitiveness and client experience in 2020. “Any financial institution that wants to stay in business in this tough economy needs to invest in the right technology and make efficient use of resources, all with the customer in mind,” Schooling said. Standard Bank rose 0.12% on the JSE yesterday to close at R152.64 ($9.70). --BusinessReport--
