The new in-app call-back feature that provides users with 24/7 access to speak to Uber’s Team after the trip, will allow users to experience a safety-related incident during their rides according to official statement announcing the feature. It was added that it has been rolled out in 9 other markets in the Middle East and Africa.  Available for all safety-related matters, the call-back feature is accessible in the “Trip and Fare Review” section in the app. Once a user submits a request to be called back, along with their contact number and a short description of the safety event, the user will then receive a call within minutes by the specialized support team to help handle the incident at hand. At the backend, trained representatives of the Incident Response Team will be available around the clock to connect with the users. Ahmed Khalil, General Manager of Uber in Egypt explained that the new feature has been introduced following on-going conversations with the Egyptian Consumer Protection Agency (CPA) to pilot a new safety feature. Khalil commented, “Rolling out the call-back feature is a step further in our safety efforts to make trips on the Uber app a more safe experience. We understand how every minute counts in critical moments, and that’s why we remain committed to design innovative features that will help Uber users to stay connected to us.” The rollout of the new feature comes as part of Uber’s continuous efforts to maintain the safety and well-being of users on the platform. Other safety features on the Uber app expand to include caller anonymization, sharing the trip details with trusted contacts, two-way accountability, real-time ID check, and GPS tracking.  --EgyptToday--
