The victims included six French aid workers. Macron termed it as a 'cowardly" attack, according to the AFP agency. The incident took place in an area renowned as the home of the last herds of giraffes in West Africa. Correspondents say the attack is likely to have been carried out by jihadists who have become increasingly active in Niger moving across the borders from Mali, Burkina Faso and Nigeria. Ten aid workers were kidnapped in June. No one immediately claimed responsibility for the assault.Â 

But France and other countries have warned people against travelling to parts of Niger where militants including Boko Haram and an affiliate of Islamic State operate. --BBC--
