The increase was partly due to the launch of production at a mine owned by Australia’s Resolute Mining, ministry official Mamadou Sidibe said. The West African country’s total gold output last year was probably around 71.1 tons due to the additional 6 tons of gold that artisanal miners are estimated to produce each year, Sidibe said. Industrial production is expected to increase further in 2020, he said, without giving further details. --Reuters--
