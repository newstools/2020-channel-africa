The South-African based team is linked to the charity Qhubeka. As the South African government plans to test 30,000 people every day, NTT Pro Cycling team leader Douglas Ryder told the BBC's Newsday programme that their donation, through Qhubeka, would help get more people tested. The team has a mission to promote cycling in Africa and has been providing bicycles to schoolchildren across South Africa under the slogan "bicycles change lives". But it has suspended handing over bicycles to children and is focusing on increasing the mobility of health workers. South Africa has to date confirmed more than 1,700 cases of coronavirus, the highest in the continent and is in the second week of a three-week-long nationwide lockdown. --BBC--
