It's the first high-level political meeting in five years between the two countries which speak similar languages and share much in their cultures. Albert Shingiro of Burundi and Vincent Biruta of Rwanda gave each other written messages from their own government, it was announced in a statement. Since 2015 Burundi has accused Rwanda of having a hand in an aborted coup and harbouring its organisers, while Rwanda accuses Burundi of supporting rebels who've led attacks on Rwanda. Political relations, trade and cross-border activities have almost frozen since then, affecting the lives of hundreds of thousands of citizens. Both Ministers discussed existing differences between the countries and insisted on the “common need to normalise relations”, their statement says. The two sides agreed to meet again on a later date. In August, military intelligence chiefs met at the same border, after some clashes of the two countries’ armies. --BBC--
