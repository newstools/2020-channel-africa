The formula for allocation of states between the political camps has been a sticking point in the transitional unity government formed in February, with both eyeing control over the oil-rich states. On Wednesday, President Kiir and Machar met at State House in the capital, Juba, and struck a deal. A statement from Minister of Presidential Affairs Nhial Deng Nhial said the states will be shared as follows: President Kiir's camp: Northern Bahr El-Ghazal state, Warap state, Lakes state, Central Equatoria state (which includes the capital, Juba), Eastern Equatoria state and Unity state. Machar camp: Western Bahr El-Ghazal state, Western Equatoria state and the major oil-producing Upper Nile state. --BBC-
