Up to 22 civilians, 14 of them children, died in the incident on Friday, according to the United Nations, deaths which opposition parties blamed on members of the armed forces. But Army Spokesperson, Colonel Cyrille Atonfack Guemo, described the allegations as "duplicitous". An army investigation, he said, found that the deaths happened after fuel was set ablaze during a gunfight with anglophone separatists. Five civilians, a woman and four children, died, and "seven terrorists" were "neutralised", Atonfack told AFP in Libreville by phone. The deaths occurred in the village of Ntumbo in Cameroon's Northwest Region, one of two English-speaking regions that have been grappling with separatist violence since October 2017. More than 3 000 people have died and at least 700 000 have fled their homes. "It was quite simply an unfortunate accident, the collateral result of security operations in the region," Atonfack said in a statement. He said four soldiers and two gendarmes had been carrying out night-time reconnaissance on foot near a home that had been "transformed into a fortress" with a stockpile of weapons. They came under heavy fire, and exchanges caused "several containers of fuel to explode, followed by a blaze which spread to several neighbouring homes", Atonfack said. --News24--
