Gauff, playing her first tournament in the coronavirus-disrupted season since she stunned defending champion Naomi Osaka at the Australian Open, lined up a quarter-final clash with eighth-seeded Tunisian Ons Jabeur, a 3-6, 6-2, 6-4 winner over Olga Govortsova. 

"I'm just happy to have pulled it through today," Gauff said after coming out on top in a see-saw battle that lasted two hours and 24 minutes. Up 5-2 in the first set, the 16-year-old American would need a tie-breaker to put it away.Sabalenka, who won her third career Premier 5 title in Qatar before the WTA Tour was suspended because of the Covid-19 pandemic, took a 5-2 lead in the second set and held off a challenge from Gauff to knot the match at a set apiece. The third set opened with a string of service breaks, Sabalenka twice clawing back a break. But Gauff gained a break to lead 5-4 and served out the match with an angled forehand winner. 

"It was all about staying calm and composed, making her play balls," Gauff said. "In the second set, I hit more double faults and errors, so my goal for the third was to change that." --News24--
