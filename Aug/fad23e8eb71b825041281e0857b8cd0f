Moses Anur Ayom, an Anglican Bishop of the Episcopal Church, said St Luke’s Cathedral - east of the state capital, Bor, was attacked two weeks ago by youth from the Murle ethnic group. The Dean of the Cathedral, Reverend Daniel Garang Ayuen, was killed and the building badly vandalised. It is not clear why it took two weeks for news of the attack to come out. The Murle, the Dinka and the Nuer have long engaged in a cycle of cattle raids and revenge attacks. The entire village of Makol Chuei is now deserted. “It was a revenge attack that led to the killing of innocent people who sought refuge inside the church compound," Bishop Anur told the BBC in the capital, Juba, on Sunday. --BBC--
