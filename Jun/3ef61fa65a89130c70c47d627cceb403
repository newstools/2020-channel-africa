The Cape Town Marathon was scheduled to take place on Sunday, October 18. 

The event is one of many major South African mass participation sporting events that had to be removed from the SA racing calendar amid the on-going Covid-19 pandemic. The road and trail Peace Runs have also been cancelled. Athletics South Africa President Aleck Skhosana said, "Cancelling this year's edition of the Cape Town Marathon was a difficult decision to make because it is also home to the ASA Marathon Championships. This is the only World Athletics Gold label marathon in Africa and it's an influential nation-builder with a massive economic impact. “We know that it will come as a great disappointment to thousands of runners who were looking forward to the race. However, the decision had to prioritise the health and safety of all involved, as well as the lives of all South Africans." Cape Town Marathon Chairperson, Francois Pienaar, called the cancellation a sad and disappointing moment.    

"This decision did not come easy, but was one that had to be made after exhausting all our options. The reality is that we simply cannot risk the health and well-being of our participants, volunteers, supporters and stakeholders. We are grateful for the ongoing support of our sponsors, partners and service providers who share our disappointment but agree that this is the most prudent option in these uncertain times." Cape Town Marathon Race Director, Renee Jordaan, confirmed that entrants will have the option to receive a full refund, or donate their entry fee to charity. "All donated entry fees will be distributed between the Peninsula School Feeding Association and Community Chest of the Western Cape to support the increased social needs during the pandemic." --News24--
