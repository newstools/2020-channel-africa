This as queues begin to form at some of the large retail stores in Johannesburg – following South African President Cyril Ramaphosa’s announcement of the national lockdown starting Thursday midnight, to help stem the spread of the coronavirus. The number of confirmed COVID-19 infections in South Africa has risen to 554. Addressing the media in Pretoria, Didiza has appealed for people to refrain from panic buying and stockpiling. She says: “Agricultural business production will remain un-compromised. I appeal to the public, as I have indicated that we are self-sufficient at the moment and there is no need to embark on panic buying, the country has sufficient food supply.” “Panic buying has caused disruption and inconvenienced the system. There is no need for panic buying in the manner that we address the challenges that we are facing.”
