The nomination of Ouattara’s close ally had been widely expected following the president’s announcement last week that he would not run in the October 31 vote, which is seen as a crucial test of the West African country’s stability. Addressing a large gathering of the Houphouetist Rally for Democracy and Peace. (RHDP), Outtara said the vast majority of the party supported Gon Coulibaly’s candidacy. “You will be in good hands,” he said. It is not clear whom Gon Coulibaly will run against. Ouattara’s two main rivals, Laurent Gbagbo and another former president, Henri Konan Bedie, have not yet said whether they will be candidates. Ouattara was first elected president of Ivory Coast, the world’s leading cocoa producer, in a 2010 election that sparked a brief civil war when his predecessor, Gbagbo, refused to concede defeat. Around 3 000 people died in the violence.
