Best known as owner of the 91-year-old department store chain Edgars and budget clothing retailer Jet, Edcon is one of South Africa's oldest retail groups but applied for a form of bankruptcy protection in April 2020. Edcon entered a process called business rescue after it failed to generate enough revenues as the coronavirus lockdown shut its stores across the country. In June, the South African Commercial Catering and Allied Workers Union supported the newly-voted business rescue plan for retail giant, Edcon. The creditors for Edcon voted in favour of the business rescue plan that could potentially see massive job cuts. Twenty-two-thousand is the number of jobs reportedly on the line at the retail group Edcon. Although 17 000 is the number of permanent employees that can be formally retrenched. --SABC--
