Voting day had been set for 16 August, which was met with criticism as it coincided with the height of the rainy season in a country where many people live in rural areas. Announcing the revised timetable, the Chair of the electoral board, Birtukan Mideksa, a former judge who was once a political prisoner, said that the end of August generally saw relatively less heavy rain. Voter registration is due to begin in April and political parties can commence their campaigns late in May. --BBC--
