Museveni said that while face masks protect people against the coronavirus, he "had to put on a very strong one" in Tanzania and "when I came back my voice was affected". He did not elaborate, but it led to him calling off a trip to Jinja district in eastern Uganda on Saturday. He sent Vice-President Edward Ssekandi instead. Tanzania's President John Magufuli has played down the threat posed by the disease, and has previously said that the country is "coronavirus-free" and God has "spared" it from the virus. When he welcomed Museveni to the country, Magufuli did not wear a face covering. He had guests laughing when he quoted the Ugandan president as telling him that he would be wearing a mask and he replied that "you can even come with a blanket". The two leaders signed an agreement allowing for the construction of a 1.445 kilometres crude oil pipeline. The $3.5 billion project will connect Uganda's oil fields to Tanzania's port of Tanga. --BBC--
