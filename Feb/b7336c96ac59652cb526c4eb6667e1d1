Turkey backs Libya’s internationally recognized Government of National Accord (GNA) and has signed a military co-operation agreement to help it repel an offensive by Haftar’s forces in the country’s east. World powers agreed at a summit last month to halt hostilities in Libya while a political process is underway. Speaking to state broadcaster TRT Haber, Cavusoglu said the “international system” had failed to stop clashes in Libya and that there was no determination. He said a political process in Libya could not move forward while Haftar’s attacks continue.
