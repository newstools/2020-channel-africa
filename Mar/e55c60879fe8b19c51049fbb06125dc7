Emirates had announced the cancellation of nearly all passenger flights this week and cut staff wages by as much as half due to the impact on travel demand caused by the coronavirus pandemic. In a statement, the airline now says it will continue to support the repatriation of travellers to countries including South Africa. The other countries include the United Kingdom (UK), Switzerland, Hong Kong, Thailand, Malaysia, Philippines, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Australia, the United States of America (USA) and Canada. However, it adds that the situation remains dynamic, and travellers are urged to continuously check the status of their flight on emirates.com. Emirates chairman Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed al-Maktoum says, “These are unprecedented times for the airline and travel industry, but we will get through it. Our business is taking a hit, but what matters in the long run is that we do the right thing for our customers, our employees, and the communities we serve.” “With the support and unity that we have seen from our employees, partners, customers, and other stakeholders, I’m confident that Emirates can tackle this challenge and come out stronger,” explains Sheikh Ahmed.
