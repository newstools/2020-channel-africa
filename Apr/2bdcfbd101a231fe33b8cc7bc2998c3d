As with worst-hit Italy, Spain has seen the rate of new infections and deaths slow in recent days, giving cause for hope the peak has passed. On Sunday, it reported 674 fatalities in the previous 24 hours, a six percent increase in total, but half the pace of a week previously. “We are preparing ourselves for de-escalation for which it is important to know who is contaminated to be able to gradually lift Spanish citizens’ lockdown,” Spanish Foreign Minister, Arancha Gonzalez, told TV station Antena 3. While so far only those infected or suspected of having the COVID-19 disease have been tested, now checks will focus on the wider population to try and find carriers who may not be displaying symptoms, Gonzalez said. Spanish companies are manufacturing 240 000 test kits per week and are boosting capacity while equipment is also being bought from abroad, the Minister said. Spain has been in lockdown since March 14 and at the weekend Prime Minister, Pedro Sanchez, said that would remain in place until April 26. However, Sanchez opened the door to easing some restrictions, such as keeping all non-essential workers at home, after Easter, even though shops and restaurants will stay shut. Spain’s death toll stood at 12 418 on Sunday, with 130 759 infections. Checkpoints were lifted on Monday in four hard-hit towns in the northeastern Catalonia region, where there have been more than 100 deaths, the Health Ministry said. --Reuters--
