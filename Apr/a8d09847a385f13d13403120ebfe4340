Washing hands with soap and water is considered one of the best ways to prevent the transmission of the virus. There have been 214 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the country and five deaths. Last week, Ghana started a two-week lockdown in three cities - Accra, Tema and Kumasi - that were identified as hotspots for the spread of the virus. In a televised address, Akufo-Addo said the government has urged the utility companies to ensure a consistent supply of water and electricity and restore any disconnected accounts. Water-supply tankers will also be made available to provide water to vulnerable communities. Meanwhile, health workers treating patients with Covid-19 will receive a boost to their basic pay and all health workers will also be granted a three-month tax holiday. --BBC--
