Chicago-based United said the program would give Abbott Laboratories’ rapid molecular ID Now tests, which take about 15 to 20 minutes, to all passengers above age two. The program will run from November 16 through December 11 on three evening flights a week from Newark Liberty International Airport to London’s Heathrow Airport. Global airlines are backing COVID-19 testing to replace or reduce 14-day quarantines and other restrictions that have battered demand. Airline trade group International Air Transport Association (IATA) in September forecasted a 66% decline in overall 2020 air traffic because of the pandemic. United passengers from Newark, New Jersey, with a negative test would still be subject to United Kingdom quarantine requirements, the carrier said. But customers would have the assurance of flying on a plane where all travelers have tested negative and the program would strengthen the carrier’s case to relax quarantines with passenger testing, a company spokesman said “They (governments) have to make a decision that is rooted in safety and so what we are trying to do is to demonstrate that it is, in fact, safe,” Josh Earnest, United’s Chief Communication Officer, told reporters.
