Last weekend's half-marathon in the French capital was also cancelled over fears of the deadly virus that has killed over 3 300 people worldwide. That race has been rearranged for September 6. "Immediately after the cancellation of the Paris half-marathon less than 24 hours before the start, the teams from the Paris city council and Amaury Sport Organisation came together to find a new date for the event. We are pleased to announce that the half-marathon will take place on September 6," Amaury Sport Organisation said in a statement. "Regarding the marathon, we have reached an agreement with Paris city council to move the marathon to October18 with the aim of avoiding any last-minute cancellation." The announcements came after the French Government on Saturday ordered the cancellation of "gatherings of more than 5 000 people" in enclosed areas as well as some external events. The French Health Ministry reported on Thursday two more deaths from coronavirus infections, bringing the country's total to six and 92 new cases since Wednesday. It was the biggest one-day jump in the number of French cases since the outbreak began, raising the total to 377. --News24--
