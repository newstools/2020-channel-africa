The United States (US) planemaker also said it was sticking with the deeply reduced twin-aisle production rates announced in July, as well as the goal to hit a build rate of 31 narrow bodies monthly in early 2022. The Covid-19 pandemic has brought air travel to a near halt, pushing major airlines to the brink of bankruptcy and forcing them to seek government aid, cut costs and defer aircraft deliveries - when Boeing gets paid most of the money for new jets. “While losing money and burning through over $5 billion in three months is hardly good news, at least it wasn’t worse than this,” Vertical Research Partners analyst Rob Stallard wrote in a note. Boeing Chief Executive Dave Calhoun said during a CNBC interview the company was nearing the finish line on winning 737 MAX approval, and expects airline traffic to end the year at around 30-35% of 2019 levels. Boeing estimates a full return to pre-pandemic levels in about three years, in line with other industry estimates.

As a result of the downturn, Boeing has slashed production, shed thousands of jobs and shifted its jet development strategy, while working to emerge from the depths of the pandemic and the 19-month-old worldwide 737 MAX ban triggered by two fatal accidents.
