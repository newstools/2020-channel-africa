The tournament had been rescheduled to its August date after being postponed from its original slot in May because of the coronavirus pandemic. The PGA of America formally confirmed the tournament would be held on Monday after weighing alternative options, which included moving the tournament to another course.    
The decision to bar spectators from the event was taken out of consideration for "the health and well-being of all involved," the PGA said. PGA of AmericaCchief Executive Seth Waugh said. "While the local community cannot be with us physically on-site, we will certainly carry their spirit of resilience and unity with us as we stage our major championship, on their behalf, for all the world to see and enjoy." PGA officials had also awaited approval from California officials before pressing ahead with the schedule. The decision comes after the PGA Tour has made a largely successful return from its Covid-19 shutdown, which forced the postponement or cancellation of all four golf majors this season.
