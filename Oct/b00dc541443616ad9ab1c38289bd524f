But as months of travel curbs dragged on, angry workers blockaded the mine for four days in August until the operator - a unit of United States (US) miner Freeport McMoRan Inc - relented and let them resume weekly rotations out of the site via a four-hour trek by cable car and bus to towns below. Now the workers are happier, but health experts fear the greater risk of a new outbreak. The tensions expose the balancing act to maintain output at full blast, while containing COVID-19 in mines like Grasberg, the world’s largest gold mine and second-largest copper mine. “We’ve put the priority and the health of our workers and community at the top of our list,” Freeport McMoRan Chief Executive Richard Adkerson told Reuters. “From the outset, we recognized that (Grasberg) was a particularly vulnerable place due to the size of the workforce” of nearly 30 000 people. While Freeport has halted some global operations due to the pandemic, production has continued at the 4 267 metre -high Grasberg mine despite Indonesia facing one of the worst coronavirus outbreaks in Southeast Asia. In May, Freeport said it would operate with a “skeletal team” because of a rise in coronavirus cases in the area, including at the workers’ living quarters.    

Freeport said at the time it was limiting contractors and removing “high-risk” workers but did not specify how many people would be working at the mine.
