In a memorandum of understanding with the locals, a Chinese oil consortium, in which the government is a shareholder, promised to clean up fuel spills and conserve the environment. The Dar Petroleum Operating Company (DPOC), the consortium made up of China National Petroleum Corporation, the majority shareholder, State-owned Nilepet, Malaysiaâ€™s Petronas, Sinopec, and Tri-Ocean Energy, operates the main oil fields, Block 3 and 7, in the Melut Basin. Last week, hundreds of youths in the area, carrying placards, barricaded roads and demanded the suspension of oil operations accusing the companies of violating environmental and safety measures. The locals, who also stormed DPOC offices in Paloch Town, also blamed the firms and the government for failing to invest in the communities as stipulated in the law. According to the Petroleum Act, the oil companies are required to improve infrastructure, employ locals, and provide amenities such as safe drinking water among other provisions. The oil-producing States are also entitled to a 3 % share of the net petroleum revenues with the communities receiving 2 %. --TheEastAfrican--
