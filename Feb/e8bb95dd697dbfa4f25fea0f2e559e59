The European Challenge Tour's South African Swing comes to an end in George this week, with 180 players teeing it up alongside an amateur partner at the stunning Fancourt Golf Estate. Players will compete for a share of the $400 000 prize fund and a spot in the WGC - FedEx St Jude Invitational and after finishing in a tie for 42 place at both the Limpopo Championship and the Cape Town Open, Scalise is hoping to make an early move on the season-long Rankings race. "It's been a long couple of weeks but it has been really good," he said. "The weather isn't great at home so it's great to be out here. "The field sizes are quite big, so it isn’t the best to have to beat 210 players to win a tournament, like the previous two weeks, but it's a really good thing to play in these conditions out here. I felt like I played well in the first two but didn't finish as high as I wanted. This would be a good week to get everything together and make a move on the Rankings. "It's huge to have a spot in the WGC up for grabs, but the prize money and the points is what really matters to us. It's just a bonus for everyone in the field. It would be a really cool experience but playing against 180 players across three courses, it's going to be one hell of a fight."
