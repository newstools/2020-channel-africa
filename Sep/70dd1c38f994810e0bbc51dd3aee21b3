CoachED Cricket is a one-of-a-kind online global cricket coach, education and accreditation programme. The courses have been developed to enable cricket coaches to learn, develop and become an accredited coach without restrictions. Kirsten achieved a lot as a player. He played 101 Tests and 185 ODI’s for South Africa. As a coach, he won the World Cup with India in 2011 and took the Proteas to o.: 1 in the world in Test cricket after beating England in a series 2012. Now, the former opening batsman says he aims to make an impact, helping other coaches from all levels of the game. “It’s an on online coach education platform. The intention behind it just to create an opportunity for coaches who aspire to become better coaches, that they have access to a body of information that allows them to upskill and become better. I think there are many barriers to entry when you want to become upskilled as a coach around the world.” He says CoachED caters for basic coaches, but also for coaches who aspire to coach at domestic and international level. “The coached platform runs over three products which is a library. It’s 11 modules then there’s the basic accreditation, which then is the follow-on from the library. The third product is the elite accreditation, which is a platform for guys that really are aspiring to become top coaches. It’s a 12-week course. There’s a lot of interaction in the course with a lot of fantastic guest coaches that we’ve interviewed that provide information for us.” For years now, Kirsten has been doing great work in Khayelitsha where the Gary Kirsten Foundation has been providing net facilities, equipment and coaching. He also launched the first artificial Cricket Oval in Khayelitsha at the Chris Hani Secondary School. CoachED has a global footprint, but also incorporates coaches from all over South Africa. --SABC--
