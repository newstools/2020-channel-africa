UN officials said there was still no access to those in need, despite the announcement on Wednesday of a deal to deliver assistance in government-held area. Residents of Tigray's regional capital Mekelle have told the BBC that fighting is continuing in places close to the city, despite the government saying the conflict is over. They say there is no electricity or water, and that looting is common. They also say civilians have been killed by federal troops, something the government denies. --BBC--
