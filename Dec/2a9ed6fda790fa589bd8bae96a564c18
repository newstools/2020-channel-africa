In November, Somalia expelled Kenyaâ€™s ambassador to Mogadishu and recalled its envoy from Nairobi. It accused Kenya of alleged interference in its internal and political affairs. Kenya's Foreign Affairs Ministry said the talks between Kenyatta and Bihi will be on "mutual interests". "Somaliland is an important partner in the Horn of Africa region in the fight against terrorism and particularly al-Shabab," it said in a tweet. This is the second visit by a Somaliland leader following a similar one by President Kahin Riyale Kahin in 2006, it added. Somaliland declared independence in 1991 but is not officially recognised by the United Nations, African Union or any country. --BBC--
