Arusha Regional Commissioner Mrisho Gambo said those who circulated the videos wanted to embarrass the country. He ordered the regional police commander to arrest and interrogate those who posted the video "to establish their motive". Gambo argued governments faced challenges which should be brought to the attention of officials and not shared online. Tanzanian privately owned television station, Azam TV, tweeted the video of the commissioner's comments (in Swahili). --BBC-- WALIOONYESHA UBOVU WA BARABARA NGORONGORO MATATANIâ€¦Mkuu wa Mkoa wa Arusha, Mrisho Gambo ameagiza polisi kuwasaka na kuwachukulai hatua watu waliotumia mitandao ya kijamii kuonesha ubovu wa miundombinu ya barabara ndani ya @NgorongoroNCAA #AzamTVUpdates #AzamNews pic.twitter.com/2XfKfKNbpl
