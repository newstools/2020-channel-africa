The United Nation (UN) says in an area called Foro Baranga, more than 2 000 farms have been completely submerged, 300 homes have collapsed and large numbers of livestock have drowned. Several rivers have burst their banks damaging villages and destroying crops. Local boats have been used to rescue people who were stranded as a result of the flash floods. The UN says people in Sudan are in urgent need of shelter materials, drinking water, food, and medicine. --BBC--
