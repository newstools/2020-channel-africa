This comes in the middle of a military confrontation between the federal government and the regional ruling party the Tigray People Liberation Front (TPLF). With an information blackout in the conflict, there are fears about the safety and welfare of civilians. The Ethiopian government said it will make a final push into the regional capital of Mekelle as a new deadline for the regionâ€™s leaders to surrender lapsed on Wednesday. The Sudanese Commission for Refugees said it had been receiving an average of 1 200 people there daily. On Wednesday a BBC reporter saw at least a dozen soldiers stationed on the hills across the river. The refugees identified them as Ethiopian federal forces and said they had been stopping people crossing into Sudan. Many refugees who have been waiting for their relatives to join them in Sudan are worried about this new development. --BBC--
