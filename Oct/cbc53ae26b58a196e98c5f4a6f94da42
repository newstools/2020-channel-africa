The two doctors were abducted in April 2019 in the northern Kenya town of Mandera by suspected members of the al-Shabab Islamist militant group. They were then taken across the border to Somalia where they have been held since. Reports say senior Somali intelligence officials have negotiated for their release at the request of the Cuban government. Reuters news agency has quoted Cuba’s Foreign Minister, Bruno Rodriguez, as confirming the release and thanking Somalia’s government for its intervention in freeing the hostages. The Cuban doctors were in Kenya under an exchange programme signed in 2018 that saw more than 100 Cuban doctors deployed to help Kenya’s health ministry while dozens of local doctors were sent to the Caribbean nation for training. --BBC--
