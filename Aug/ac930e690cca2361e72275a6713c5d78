Liberty's pandemic reserve, which is R3 billion ($173.6 million) before tax, was established to cushion the group from the financial impact of Covid-19. It takes into account excess mortality, excess withdrawals and policy lapses and expenditure directly attributable to Covid-19. "The Covid-19 pandemic is causing high levels of anxiety and uncertainty for our clients, advisers and staff," it said. "Government imposed lockdowns have been introduced in all countries in which Liberty operates, resulting in recessionary economic environments in these countries." Death and disability payments made by Liberty in the past six months increased by 5.1% to R5.3 billion ($306.8 million). Annuity payments increased by 6.1% to R4.1 billion ($237.4 million). "Death claims related to the Covid-19 pandemic have been low to date however are starting to increase, mostly within the funeral books in the SA Retail and Liberty Corporate businesses," it said. The group expects continued pressure on new business volumes and its margins due to the extended lockdown period and "financial distress" prevalent in South Africa, but said it is still well capitalised to service its clients. --News24--
