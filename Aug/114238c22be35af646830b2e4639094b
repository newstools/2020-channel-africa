Tafadzwa Mugwadi, the Zanu-PF director of information and publicity, said he was making an "unreserved apology" for using "uncouth language" after losing his temper during a panel discussion with representatives of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) Alliance. "Although that was never meant for the interview as I felt the interview had ended, I strongly feel I owe Al Jazeera, the world, Zimbabweans and in particular Anchor Femi Oke an unreserved apology," he said. "I further apologise to the leadership of the party, who certainly were embarrassed by these words," Mugwadi added. The discussion had been heated, and included "biased video interludes which appeared to be aimed at sustaining a false narrative that there is a crisis of human rights in Zimbabwe", Mugwadi said. "I lost my temper in which I ended up using uncouth language," he added. --BBC--
