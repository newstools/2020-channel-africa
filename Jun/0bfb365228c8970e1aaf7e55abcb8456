The troubled country is in need of aid estimated at around $2.2 billion. But it has not been very successful in getting the help it needs as its Finance Ministry reported earlier this month that Zimbabwe had only amassed less than $200 million in cash donations. The World Bank, European Union and the United Kingdom are among those who have previously extended helping hands. The African Development Bank plans to provide up to $10 billion to African governments and the private sector to help the continent provide better health responses to Covid-19 and mitigate the impact of the economic downturn that the pandemic has brought with it. AfDB forecasts that Covid-19 will cause Africaâ€™s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to drop by between $22.1 billion and $88.3 billion this year. It said five geographical regions in the continent had received its Covid-19 emergency packages by June 12. Other countries that will benefit from these support packages include a few in West Africa, North Africa, Kenya in the East, Mauritius and DRC. --News24--
