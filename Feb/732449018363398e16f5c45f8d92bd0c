His son said he had not fled the country, but was in South Africa for medical treatment. His current wife, Maesaiah Thabane, has also been charged with murdering her predecessor. Lipolelo Thabane was shot dead in 2017, two days before her husband was inaugurated as Prime Minister. There has been pressure for Thabane to resign immediately but he said on Thursday he would step down in July. He has not commented on the allegations against him.
