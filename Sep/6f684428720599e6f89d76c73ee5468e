The format of the tour is undecided, with New Zealand Cricket still awaiting government approval, although men's series against West Indies and Pakistan are going ahead from November. The series will take place at the time originally scheduled for England's 50-over World Cup defence, which was due to be played in New Zealand. That tournament is now in 2022. The White Ferns are also hoping to arrange a series against Australia, who they are currently 2-0 down to in a three-match Twenty20 series. --BBC--
