Last month Foreign Affairs and International Trade Minister Dr Sibusiso Moyo set the stage for better collaboration between Zimbabwe and the US when he held fruitful talks with the US Assistant Secretary, Bureau of African Affairs, Ambassador Tibor Nagy. In that engagement Moyo told Ambassador Nagy that President Mnangagwa is keen to close the long chapter of suspicion between Zimbabwe and the US so that the two countries can be on the same page. he gesture by the US is a sign of relations on the mend, and the US$5 million initiative is specifically for youths to help them emerge from the economic pinch brought by the Covid-19 pandemic and the resulting lockdown. “USAID would like young people to take the driver’s seat,” said USAID’s Zimbabwe Mission Director Mr Art Brown at the Local Works Zimbabwe Stakeholder virtual meeting yesterday. “Our approach under the Local Works programme is slightly different from the traditional method of development programme design and implementation. We want you as young people to take the lead in defining and addressing the diverse challenges you face so that we support you to meet your social and economic needs.” Brown was clear in his presentation that Zimbabwe has the capacity to address its challenges since the country was already recording successes on the macroeconomic front after managing to stabilise the prices and the exchange rate through the auction system. --Herald--
