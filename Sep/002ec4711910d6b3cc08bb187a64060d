The constitutional council said he could not run as he was not on the electoral roll because he was convicted of a financial crime several years ago. Gbagbo, who is living in exile, already knew that he would be rejected and put his name forward as a way to rally his supporters. The government does not want the former president to return to the country as this could mean he would have more influence on his supporters at a time when there is already tension in the country. There have been protests in several parts of the main city, Abidjan, and in several other cities. Tensions rose in August when President, Alassane Ouattara, announced that he would run for a third term. --BBC--
