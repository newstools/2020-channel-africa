Days after winning Formula One's World Championship for a record-equalling seventh time, he's topped the Powerlist 2021. The list honours the most powerful people of African, African Caribbean and African American heritage in the UK. This year, there's been a special focus on two of the biggest themes of 2020 - coronavirus and racial injustice. The independent judging panel looked at people who have the "ability to change lives and alter events, as demonstrated over a protracted period of time and in a positive manner". The award is not just for his awesome driving ability. He's Formula 1's only black driver and has been very vocal in support of the Black Lives Matter movement, especially since the death of George Floyd. Back in June, he encouraged his fellow F1 drivers to take a knee before races - and has launched The Hamilton Commission, aiming to increase the number of black people in motor racing.
