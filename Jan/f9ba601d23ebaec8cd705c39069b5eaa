That adds to the World Rugby Player of the Year accolade he’s already won. 

Du Toit is the third player to be named South Africa’s player of the year three times, after Naas Botha and Bryan Habana. Rassie Erasmus and the Springboks also added the South African titles to their World Rugby awards, as they were named coach and team of the year.     

They were also honoured for a brilliant 2019, when they won the Rugby World Cup and Castle Lager Rugby Championship, as well as the World Rugby Awards for Coach and Team of the Year, by walking away with the same awards in South Africa. Other big winners from the Boks’ Rugby World Cup squad included Herschel Jantjies, the Young Player of the Year and Handré Pollard as Super Rugby Player of the Year. Springbok Sevens Player of the Year, Siviwe Soyizwapi, had a stellar year for the Bitzboks, finishing the 2018/19 season as leading try-scorer and playing in all 10 tournaments.      

Number eight Aseza Hele is the Springbok Women’s Achiever of the Year.
