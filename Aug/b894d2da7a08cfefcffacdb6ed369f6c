After opening with a 68 at Harding Park, consecutive rounds of 72 left Woods out of contention for a 16th major title and among the early starters on Sunday. But the 44-year-old put in a characteristically professional display to card five birdies and two bogeys in a closing 67 to finish one under par overall in just his fourth tournament of 2020 due to injury and the coronavirus pandemic. "I drove it like I did on Friday, my irons were a little crisper and I hit better putts," Woods said. "An under-par tournament score, that's what I said I wanted yesterday and made it happen today." Asked what he would take out of the week, Woods added: "What I get out of this week is that I felt competitive. If I had made a few more putts on Friday and Saturday I would have been right there with a chance." At the head of affairs, England's Paul Casey was firmly in contention on a highly congested leaderboard as some more generous pin positions led to a raft of birdies from the final groups. Seeking a maiden major title at the 64th attempt, Casey birdied the fourth and fifth to reach nine under par and a six-way tie for the lead with Dustin Johnson, Bryson DeChambeau, Collin Morikawa, Scottie Scheffler and Cameron Champ. The best rounds of the day so far had come from An Byeong-hun and Ryan Palmer, who both shot 64 in some style. Palmer holed from 12 feet for an eagle after driving the green on the short, par-four 16th and birdied the last two holes, while An's round included a hole-in-one from 189 yards with a six iron on the 11th. Rory McIlroy matched Woods in recording his best score of the week in the final round, a closing 68 leaving the four-time major winner on two under par.
