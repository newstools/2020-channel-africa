France's national airline said an investigation was underway. "Air France confirms that the lifeless body of a stowaway was found in the landing gear compartment of the aircraft operating flight AF703 from Abidjan to Paris-Charles de Gaulle on January 7, 2020." Air France said in a statement. Air France expressed its "deepest sympathy and compassion at this human tragedy". Air France declined to comment on French media reports that the stowaway was a child. A source in the office of the local prosecutor leading the investigation said she was not aware of the stowaway's age or identity. --Reuters--
