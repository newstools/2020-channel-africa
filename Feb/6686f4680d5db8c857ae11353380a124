The club's all-time record goalscorer missed again from the spot in City’s narrow 1-0 victory over Leicester at the King Power Stadium last weekend before being substituted shortly after. The Citizens have now missed five of their last seven penalties, including their last four in the Premier League - Ilkay Gundogan, Gabriel Jesus and Raheem Sterling also fluffing their lines from 12 yards out. Aguero, however, reportedly told team-mates after the Foxes’ win that he will again put himself forward if the opportunity arises at the Bernabeu. It is understood the Argentina international had been putting in extra practise prior to the game against Brendan Rodgers’ team in a bid to rectify City's poor record this season. And boss Pep Guardiola has insisted he is happy to continue leaving the responsibility of taking penalties up to his players.
