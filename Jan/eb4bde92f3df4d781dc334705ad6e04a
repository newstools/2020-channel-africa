Meetings involving Haftar and the Government of National Accord (GNA) began on Monday. Both Russia, which backs Haftar, and Turkey, which supports the GNA, were behind efforts to reach a truce. The deal was aimed at ending nine months of fighting around the capital. The violence began in April when Gen Haftar announced an offensive to seize the city from the United Nations-backed authorities. Turkey's President, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has warned his country would "teach a lesson" to Haftar if he resumed his attacks on GNA forces in Tripoli. The role of international actors in the Libyan conflict has come into focus in recent months, with Turkey passing a controversial law to deploy troops to help GNA forces fighting in Tripoli. Meanwhile, Haftar is also backed by Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Jordan, raising fears that oil-rich Libya could become the theatre of a regional conflict. Over the weekend, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that Berlin would to host another round of Libyan peace talks to build on the efforts by Turkey and Russia later in January. --BBC--
