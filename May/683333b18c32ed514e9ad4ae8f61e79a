The three, Member of Parliament Joana Mamombe and two youth leaders, are accused of promoting public violence on May 13 and flouting coronavirus lockdown regulations. The charges have been laid while the three remain in hospital receiving treatment for their injuries. The three female opposition members say they were abducted after the protest and sexually assaulted by state agents. The government denies any responsibility and says the abductions were faked. Two journalists arrested last week for trying to interview the three were granted bail on Tuesday. The opposition party Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) has accused the government of using lockdown restrictions to clamp down on civil liberties. --BBC--
