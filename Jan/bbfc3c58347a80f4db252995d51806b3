Major Fatima Isaacs was charged with wilful defiance and disobeying a lawful command after she failed to comply when her superior asked her to remove her headscarf. The army withdrew the charges at a military court at the Castle of Good Hope near Cape Town and said Major Isaacs was allowed to wear a headscarf as long as it did not cover her ears and was "plain in colour".
