It says the figures are from the National Disaster Risk Management Commission. The commission's spokesperson Debebe Zewede is quoted as saying that initial assessment indicates that the country is in need of over $1 billion in humanitarian aid. He said that Ethiopia has been facing a recurrent drought which is affecting the country's economy and the lives of the people. Debebe added that six million people are receiving food aid this year compared to eight million last year, though it is not clear if they are part of the seven million in need of food aid. Ethiopia is Africa's second-most populous country with a population of approximately 113 million people. --BBC--
