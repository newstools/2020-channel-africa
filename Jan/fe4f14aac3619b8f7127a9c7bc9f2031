Confirmation of the five-time NBA champion's death in a helicopter crash came during the Ligue 1 game. Neymar gave PSG the lead with a 20-yard curling effort in the first half. After scoring a second-half penalty, he held up two fingers on one hand and four on the other, marking Bryant's Los Angeles Lakers shirt number 24. The Brazil international, who is a basketball fan and had met Bryant, also bowed and pointed to the sky. He also wrote an Instagram post after the game calling Bryant, who was 41, a legend. --BBC--
