The order comes after Kabuga's lawyers asked that he be transferred to the Dutch city instead of Arusha in Tanzania, saying long-haul air travel would pose a health risk to the 85-year-old businessman because of the Covid-19 pandemic. "I hereby amend the arrest warrant and order of transfer," Arusha-based judge Iain Bonomy said, ordering the Mechanism for International Criminal Tribunals "to modify Kabuga's conditions of detention to allow for his detention there." Judge Bonomy cited "exceptional circumstances" in making the order, adding that it would be in the "interest of justice to order that Kabuga be transferred temporarily to... the Hague Branch for a detailed medical assessment." The UN tribunal, a successor to the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda international war crimes tribunals, has courtrooms both in The Hague and in the Tanzanian city. Kabuga, arrested near Paris in May after 25 years on the run, is being sought over his alleged role in the 1994 Rwanda genocide by Hutu extremists of some 800 000 minority Tutsis as well as moderate Hutus. --TheEastAfrican--
