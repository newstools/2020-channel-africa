Jones, whose only professional loss in 27 fights came by way of disqualification, has been the dominant force in the division for almost a decade, but bans for doping and issues outside the octagon have tarnished his otherwise stellar fighting record. “Just got off the phone with the UFC, today I confirm that I’m vacating the light heavyweight championship. It’s officially up for grabs,” Jones wrote on Twitter, adding in a subsequent tweet that the promoter refused to renegotiate his pay. Jones gave no indication as to what he plans to do next, tweeting only that “In good faith I will be staying in the (USADA) testing pool for probably the next half year or so. I’ll continue to lift weights and train all the different martial arts.” --Reuters--
