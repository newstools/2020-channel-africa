Former Prime Minister Umaro Cissoko Embalo was declared winner of the run-off vote by the electoral commission on Wednesday. Pereira’s complaint looks set to extend the political chaos that has dogged the tiny ocean-side country in recent years and made voters weary of the political class. The 56-year-old, who easily won a November first round, told supporters that in some polling stations votes surpassed the number of enrolled voters and he would file a complaint to the Supreme Court. “There has been an infringement of the electoral truth and the most legitimate rights of the people of Guinea Bissau,” he said. Embalo’s candidacy gained support from the main contenders who failed to reach the run-off, including Vaz.
