Mbappe converted his 16th international goal with 11 minutes remaining from Lucas Digne's brilliant cross. Antoine Griezmann had crashed in the opener via the underside of the bar after eight minutes. Ex-Everton midfielder, Nikola Vlasic, poked in an equaliser in the Group A3 match, before Mbappe struck. Croatia should have found another equaliser in injury time but ex-Leicester striker Andrej Kramaric scuffed a shot straight at Hugo Lloris from inside the box. Manchester United forward Anthony Martial somehow side-footed wide from six yards out for France, while Ivan Perisic curled a free-kick narrowly over. In Group A3's other game, defending champions Portugal, minus Cristiano Ronaldo, comfortably beat Sweden 3-0 to stay top. Liverpool's new signing Diogo Jota scored twice, with Manchester City's Bernardo Silva getting the other goal. --BBC--
