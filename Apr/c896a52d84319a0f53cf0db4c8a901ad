Egypt on the other side has announced that night time curfew hours will be shortened for the Ramadhan duration as well. Algeria’s Prime Minister said the full lockdown in the Blida province south of Algiers will be replaced with a curfew from 2pm to 7am while a 3pm to 7am curfew in nine provinces, including Algiers, will be shortened to run from 5pm to 7am. The government made no changes to the confinement measures in the remaining provinces where a 7pm to 7am curfew has been imposed for weeks. “The government reiterates its call for citizens to remain vigilant,” the Prime Minister’s office said in a statement.” Changing or keeping the confinement measures will depend on the evolution of the epidemiological situation.” In Egypt, Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly said the curfew will begin at 21:00 local time, an hour later from the previous time, starting Friday. More businesses will be allowed to reopen during Ramadhan and restaurants will be allowed to offer food delivery services. Communal prayers are still not allowed and mosques will remain closed. Social gatherings are still banned in the country. Egypt’s night-time curfew was imposed on March 24 when the country had 366 confirmed cases of coronavirus. Egypt currently has 3 891 cases of coronavirus and 287 deaths while Algeria has so far reported 3 007 cases of the novel coronavirus, with 407 deaths and 1 355 recoveries. --BBC/Reuters--
