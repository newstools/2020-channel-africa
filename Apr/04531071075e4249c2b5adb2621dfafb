More than 6.6 million people filed jobless claims in the week ended March 28, the Department of Labor said. That is nearly double the week earlier, which was also a new record.

The deepening economic crisis comes as the number of cases in the United States (US) soars to more than 216 000. With the death toll rising, the White House recently said it would retain the restrictions on activity to try to slow the spread of the virus.

In a Bank of America Global Research report on Thursday, analysts warned the US could see "the deepest recession on record", as the unemployment rate hits more than 15% and growth falls 10.4%.
