The incident reportedly happened following an altercation between one of his aides and some aides to his wife Aisha Buhari, and included her security guards. The guards insisted that the presidential aide must self-isolate for 14 days on returning from a trip outside the capital, Abuja - in accordance with government issued guidelines to prevent the spread of coronavirus. The security guards reportedly fired in the air. No casualties were reported. Some staff attached to the first lady have been taken into custody by the police. The incident happened last week but the news emerged at the weekend with both Buhari and his wife making statements. Buhari says armed guards and other security personnel assigned to the presidency were given the necessary training especially in weapons handling and "where they come short, their relevant agencies have their rules and regulations to immediately address them". A government statement says that the President ‘’is not, and was not at anytime in any form of danger arising, either from deadly infections or the reported incident by security personnel which is currently under investigation". A statement issued by Buhari’s Spokesperson, Garba Shehu, said the "minor" incident happened outside the main residence of the president. Earlier, in a tweet, First Lady Aisha Buhari called on the Chief of Police to release her staff ‘’in order to avoid putting their lives in danger or exposure to Covid-19 while in their custody". The latest incident is seen as yet another sign of internal wrangling in Nigeria’s government where officials often publicly disagree. --BBC--
