A White House statement amended the timing of the start of the restrictions to 11:59 pm Eastern Time on Tuesday, May 26 (0359 GMT on Wednesday, May 27) instead of May 28 as in the original announcement on Sunday. Two days earlier, Brazil overtook Russia as the world’s No.2 coronavirus hotspot after the US. Washington’s ban applies to foreigners traveling to the United States if they had been in Brazil in the last two weeks. Brazil’s coronavirus deaths reported in the last 24 hours were higher than fatalities in the US for the first time on Monday, according to the Health Ministry. Brazil registered 807 deaths and 620 died in the US. Brazil has 374 898 cases, behind the US with 1.637 million. Total deaths in the US has reached 97 988, according to Reuters tally, compared with Brazil at 23 473. The White House did not give a reason for bringing the travel restriction forward. The US Department of Homeland Security, which oversees immigration issues, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The travel ban was a blow to right-wing Brazilian President, Jair Bolsonaro, who has followed the example of US President, Donald Trump, in addressing the pandemic, fighting calls for social distancing and touting unproven drugs. “It undermines Bolsonaro’s claim to have built a relationship with Trump and Brazil is now seen as a privileged ally of the United States,” said Creomar de Souza, at Brasilia-based consultancy, Dharma Political Risk And Strategy. Bolsonaro has played down the gravity of the pandemic from the start calling the novel coronavirus a “little cold.” In the early stages, Trump said he believed the virus would soon go away. The White House said the travel ban on Brazil would help ensure foreign nationals do not bring additional infections to the United States, but would not apply to the flow of commerce. Trump’s National Security Adviser, Robert O’Brien, said he hoped the ban would be temporary. --Reuters--
