Uwavera Omozuwa was studying near her home in Benin City when she was raped and killed, her sister said. In a tweet Mr Buhari condemned what he called a "barbaric act", saying he expected the police to investigate the case quickly to ensure justice was served. In the past week there has been widespread anger in Nigeria following a number of violent attacks against women. On Sunday, 12 people were arrested following allegations connecting them to the rape of a 12-year-old girl, over a period of two months in north-western Nigeria. The case came to light just days after 16-year-old Tina Ezekwe was shot dead by a policeman in Lagos. Police say two officers are in custody. --BBC--
