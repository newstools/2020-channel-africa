In a second letter to Home Secretary Priti Patel, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) said there has been no "significant action to bring this injustice to an end". The BRC, which signed the letter with MPs, estimates workers have lost $35 million in unpaid earnings since July 202. The Home Office said it was working to stamp out exploitation and abuse. In July, companies including Marks & Spencer, Next and Asos - along with investors, MPs and human rights groups - called on the government to implement a scheme to ensure textile workers were paid a legal minimum wage. The group's letter to Ms Patel said: "We are writing as a broad coalition of parliamentarians, businesses, investors and civil society organisations about our concerns regarding the unethical labour practices taking place in garment factories across the UK. "We request that urgent action is taken by the government to implement a 'fit to trade' licensing scheme that ensures all garment factories is meeting their legal obligations to their employees." That letter followed revelations about conditions in textile factories in Leicester that prompted fashion group Boohoo to launch an urgent review into its suppliers. A Sunday Times investigation about conditions in Leicester factories found that some staff were paid below the legal minimum and worked without coronavirus safety measures in place. --BBC--
