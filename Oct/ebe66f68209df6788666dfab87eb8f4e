The two-day national strike is in solidarity with lawyers in the capital Algiers, who started their own stoppage on Sunday. The lawyers say that there have been arbitrary arrests and an effort by the authorities to push through a new constitution. The powerful elite in Algeria has been shaken by mass protests demanding reform that started in February last year. --BBC--
