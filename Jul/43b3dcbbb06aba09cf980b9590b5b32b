Tanzania's constitution does not allow courts to inquire or challenge the election of a president once the winner is officially announced by the electoral commission. The African Court on Human and People's Rights, which is based in the north-eastern city of Arusha, asked Tanzania to take the "necessary constitutional and legislative measures, within a reasonable time" to amend the law. The case was filed by a Tanzanian citizen, Jebra Kabole, who argued that the provision in his country's laws violated his rights. Tanzania general elections are due to be held in October. Kenya and Malawi are the only African countries that have had presidential elections annulled following successful petitions in court, forcing a rerun in both cases. --BBC--
