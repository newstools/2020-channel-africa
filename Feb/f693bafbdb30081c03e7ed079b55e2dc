Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, Rwanda's Paul Kagame South Sudan's Salva Kiir and Ethiopia's Sahle-Work Zewde were among the heads of state who were led to the platform where Moi's casket was placed. They stood at a distance and bowed one by one to the half-opened casket, then shook the hand of their host President Uhuru Kenyatta. The heads of state also shook the hands of former President Moi's family members.
