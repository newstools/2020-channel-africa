The French World Cup winner's future remains uncertain at Old Trafford, with rumours rife that he could still leave the club this summer. Real Madrid and Juventus are the two clubs consistently linked with big-money moves for the 27-year-old, and now Calciomercato, as cited by the Daily Express, claims Ramsey could be used in a swap deal to bring the midfielder back to Turin. Pogba has made just eight appearances for the Red Devils this season due to a number of injuries, while Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was also involved in a public spat with his 'super-agent' Mino Raiola earlier in the campaign. The report claims that Juve boss Maurizio Sarri is happy with Ramsey and believes the Wales star was showing his best form before the season came to a temporary halt. The Italian also still sees a future for Ramsey at Juve, but the report adds that if Pogba was offered in a swap deal then the reigning Serie A champions would be prepared to use the former Arsenal star as leverage to get their man. It could be a deal that suits both clubs, with United able to part ways with a player whose heart does not seem to be in it anymore, while Solskjaer also lands a box-to-box midfielder with tons of Premier League experience.
