According to The Sun, three Premier League clubs are interested in signing the Togo international, who made a name for himself in England’s top-flight this month. Newcastle United, Aston Villa and Brighton & Hove Albion have all expressed reported interest in signing the 35-year-old who has 97 Premier League goals to his name. Adebayor is currently a free agent after leaving Turkish Super Lig club Kayserispor last month. The veteran forward started his Premier League journey at Arsenal before swapping the Emirates for big-spending Manchester City in 2009. Following a brief spell at Real Madrid he joined Arsenal’s North London rivals Tottenham Hotspur and eventually Crystal Palace before furthering his career in Turkey. --AllAfrica--
