It needs to become industrialised to a degree,” said Paul Molinaro, in charge of operations, support and logistics at WHO in response to a question about how countries can ramp up their efforts to fight the virus amid the shortages. WHO Director-General, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, also told journalists he was working with the private sector to increase production of protective equipment, describing the current shortage as a “market failure”. --Reuters--
