Mali's junta has been under intense pressure from West African leaders to return power to civilians following the coup that overthrew President Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta more than a month ago. Ndaw is a retired colonel-major who served as Keïta's defence minister. West African leaders insisted last week that a civilian be appointed interim president, while signalling that they would accept a soldier as deputy leader, during an 18-month-long transition that would end with elections. It is not yet clear if Ndaw will be accept by Ecowas, or by the opposition parties. --BBC--
