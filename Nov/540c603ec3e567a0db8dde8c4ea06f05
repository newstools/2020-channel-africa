He released a statement after meeting Ethiopia's Foreign Minister Demeke Mekonnen in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi. The Kenyan president's call comes after a similar comment from Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni after he met Â Demeke earlier on Monday. Kenyatta "cautioned against a full-blown conflict in the country saying Kenya and Ethiopia have for long served as anchor states for regional peace and stability", according to a statement from the president's office. He also urged the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) "to de-escalate the conflict" saying the crisis risks eroding gains made by Ethiopians in developing their country. The Ethiopian government has ruled out sitting down for talks with the TPLF who it sees as a "clique" intent on destroying Ethiopia's constitutional order. But it is coming under increasing pressure to find an alternative to fighting. --BBC--
