Bidvest Bank has confirmed that it issued a Section 189 letter to affected staff last Friday. The bank also says it has experienced reduced demand for certain products and services. It added that COVID-19 has now brought about a need to accelerate the use of digitalisation and implement remote banking. The bank says reasons for the redundancy have already been communicated to staff and further discussions on the issue will be addressed during the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) facilitation process. Chairperson n of the Bidvest Group Bonang Mohale says the company is also amongst other companies severely impacted by COVID-19. “As a direct result of the pandemic, the Bidvest Group like most companies is reviewing its operations across the Group to ensure not just our short term survival but long-term sustainability. Our first thought is always with the employees during this difficult time. This is but one part of the downsizing of our entire business. The bank has been repositioned to virtual banking and this has been approved by both the Bidvest Group Excco and Bank board of directors.” The bank also says there are approximately 1037 permanent employees, of this number, approximately 651 employees will be affected in the Personal Banking, Business Banking, and Support divisions. --SABC--
