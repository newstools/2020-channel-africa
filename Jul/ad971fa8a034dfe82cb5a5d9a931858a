The 20-year-old posted four photos on social media with the right side of her face, upper torso and arm all painted black. They were accompanied by the word "equality". Hours later, however, she deleted the post. "Earlier today I posted pictures that I thought would spread a message of equality. It clearly did not and has been misunderstood," she wrote on Twitter. "I have been warned about the negative impact but I did not, and still don't, consider it a 'black face'. "I did not intend to caricature but to share my feelings about the current situation: we should all be treated as equal. "I am so disappointed my message has been corrupted. I sincerely apologise to all the people I have offended." Yastremska has won three Women's Tennis Association titles in her career and has a Grand Slam best run of a fourth round spot at Wimbledon in 2019. --News24--
