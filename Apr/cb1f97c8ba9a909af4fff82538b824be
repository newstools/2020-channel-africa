This is the first legal complaint of its kind. The organisations are asking the European Court of Auditors to review the programmes funded by the EU Trust Fund For Africa in its operations in Libya. The aim of the complaint is to get auditors to determine if the EU is in breach of their financial and human rights obligations towards refugees and migrants. The three international organisations, which include the Global Legal Action Network, are essentially accusing the EU of misusing the trust fund budget, which allocated $97m (£78m) to a project for Libya’s border management, including training Libya’s coastguard for migration control. In the past, the EU has persistently argued that they are only supporting Libya’s coastguard so that lives can be saved at sea. But the EU is now being accused of violating their own financial management principles, and failing to provide the necessary oversight to protect the human rights of refugees and migrants affected by this programme.  --BBC--
