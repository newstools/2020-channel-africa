Of 19 economists surveyed by Bloomberg in February, 14 expect Moody’s to downgrade the country to junk this year and nine of those say it’ll happen in the first half.   
 
That’s after the ratings company in November 2019 cut the outlook on the nation’s assessment to negative and said it would look to the February 26 budget for a feasible strategy to contain rising debt. Bailouts for state-owned companies including Eskom and South African Airways have pushed up government debt in an economy that’s growing at less than 1% a year and not collecting enough revenue. Pledges by Mboweni to lower spending will be difficult to push through, even after President Cyril Ramaphosa said in his state-of-the-nation address the minister will outline measures to reduce expenditure and improve its composition.    

Labour costs make up 35% of spending and trade unions have ruled out a review of an existing three-year wage agreement that expires in 2021, saying they won’t accept pay cuts in the next deal. Nothing will be done to limit the growth in the wage bill, according to Johann Els, chief economist at Old Mutual Investment Group in Cape Town. “While I expect Treasury to make an attempt to get the deficit under control and to try and stabilize the debt ratio, I think it is unlikely that they will be able to do enough to prevent a Moody’s ratings downgrade,” he said.
