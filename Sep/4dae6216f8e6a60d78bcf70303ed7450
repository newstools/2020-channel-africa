The cabinet said it "considers the advertisement profoundly offensive and racist", according to a statement. The advert had pictures of African hair labelled dry, dull and damaged, while an example of white hair was described as fine and flat. Clicks has apologised, pulled the advert from its digital platforms and removed TRESemmé products from its shelves. "Black hair has been the subject of intense politicisation and a source of unjust discrimination in our recent history. Our nation’s history is littered with laws and societal norms that equated 'blackness’ and the associated physical traits, for example, dark skin and curly hair to a badge of inferiority," the cabinet said. The retailer has said it will increase its support for local beauty, hair care brands and other products. Chief Executive Vikesh Ramsunder on Thursday met South Africa's Minister of small business development, Khumbudzo Ntshavheni, and said the company will use shelf space initially occupied by TRESemmé products to support more local brands. --BBC--
