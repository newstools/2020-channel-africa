A statement from Abiy Ahmed's office said: It is important to note that the virus is NOT related to any country or nationality. Everyone is equally at risk and therefore adhering to the evidence based Ministry of Health prevention and care guidelines is essential. Prevention efforts need not be a barrier to our humanity and disposition for compassion. As a global community, we are each otherâ€™s keepers. Let us not let fear rob us of our humanity." Ethiopia, a major trade hub on the continent, has so far recorded six cases of the virus, including a Japanese and United Kingdom diplomat. Earlier, the United States embassy in Ethiopia said it had received reports that foreigners had been stoned, spat at and denied transport after being accused of being infected with Covid-19. And the Foreign Correspondents Association in Ethiopia has said that dangerous rumours are also being spread online about two journalists. People should not circulate the "vicious" posts and should instead report them to the authorities, it said. --BBC--
