Mahama led Ghana between 2012 and 2017. He ran for office again in this month's presidential election but came a close second with 47.36% of the vote, according to the electoral body. He also accused the military of interfering in the election, and told reporters, "We will take all legitimate steps to reverse this tragedy of justice". Mahama said the verification process hadnâ€™t been followed, making the vote "illegal", Bloomberg reports. --BBC--
