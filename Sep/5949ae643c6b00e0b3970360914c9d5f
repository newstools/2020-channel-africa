The global coronavirus death toll rose past a million on Tuesday, according to a Reuters tally, a grim statistic in a pandemic that has devastated the global economy, overloaded health systems and changed the way people live. “So many people have lost so many people and haven’t had the chance to say goodbye. Many people who died died alone... It’s a terribly difficult and lonely death,” WHO Spokesperson, Margaret Harris, told a United Nations briefing in Geneva. “The one positive thing about this virus is it is suppressible, it is not the flu.” --Reuters--
