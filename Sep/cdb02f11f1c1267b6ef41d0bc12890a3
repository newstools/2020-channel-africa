"I understand the dissatisfaction of some athletes who signed the proposal, but there are many unanswered questions," the Spaniard said Monday ahead of his return to tennis from the coronavirus break at the Rome Masters. "I think it's not the right moment. And even if we weren't in the current situation, many things are not clear." World number one Djokovic announced the formation of a new group at the end of August but was widely criticised by Nadal, world number four Roger Federer and the ATP men's organisation. "There are a number of things that are not right. We are going through an world crisis in every aspect," Nadal said. "It's a difficult time for all of us, for players, for the organisers, for the whole tour. We should stick together, and not pursue each of us our own interests." Rafael Nadal disagrees with Novk Djokovic that the time is right to form a new Professional Tennis Players Association.

"He certainly didn't want to hurt anyone, but it's important to have self-control on the court." --DPA--
