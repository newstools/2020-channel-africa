It is the latest twist in a long-running row with Washington over subsidies granted to the plane maker, Airbus. For more than a decade, the EU and US have accused each other of propping up their home aviation markets with tax breaks, research grants and other aid. In June, the US threatened duties on EU goods such as beer, gin and olives, escalating the row. On Monday, Europe's Trade Commissioner Phil Hogan said Washington had rejected moves to settle the dispute. "I want to reassure people that we are ready to act decisively and strongly on the EU side if we don't get the type of outcome that we expect from the US in relationship to finalising this 15-year-old dispute," he told the European Parliament's trade committee. The World Trade Organisation (WTO) has already ruled that subsidies given by the EU to Airbus in 2004 were illegal. However, it is also considering a parallel case involving illegal support for US aerospace firm Boeing, which could see the EU impose duties on Washington later in 2020. In line with the WTO ruling, the US in 2019 imposed tariffs of 15-25% on $7.5 billion worth of European goods. --BBC--
