The East African nation has four confirmed cases of the COVID-19 and the government has imposed measures aimed at reducing its spreads including banning public gatherings and closing schools indefinitely. “We don’t want this health crisis to become a financial crisis,” Patrick Njoroge, the Governor, told a televised news conference. Small and medium enterprises who encounter difficulties will also be allowed to restructure their bank loans at no cost, he added. --Reuters--
