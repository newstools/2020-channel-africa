Five abductees are South Korean nationals, while the sixth person is said to be Ghanaian, according to media reports quoting the South Korea's foreign ministry. Maritime security company Dryad Global reports that the speed boat used to attack Ghanaian-flagged Panofi Frontier was last seen heading towards Nigerian waters after the abduction. South Korean media reports that the foreign ministry has set up an emergency group to work on the release of the abductees.
