After months of talks on a deal to protect trade between the two neighbours from possible quotas and tariffs, the two sides have yet to close significant differences on at least two main sticking points. Any deal should be agreed by mid-November 2020 to allow for ratification, with some businesses hoping that the time pressure and a COVID-19 crisis spiralling across much of Europe can focus minds to avoid disruption at the end of the year. The chief negotiators, the EU’s Michel Barnier and Britain’s David Frost, will resume talks in London on Monday to “redouble efforts to reach a deal”, Johnson’s office has said.

“I’ve always been a great enthusiast for a trade deal with our European friends and partners,” Johnson told reporters. “I think it’s there to be done, the broad outlines are pretty clear. We just need to get on and do it if we can. And I said that to (European Commission President) Ursula Von der Leyen just yesterday. And she totally agrees with me.” Earlier, foreign minister Dominic Raab told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show that there was “a good chance of a deal if we get the flexibility from the EU on fisheries and a level playing field”.
