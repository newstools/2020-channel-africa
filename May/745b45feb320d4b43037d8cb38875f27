The troops from Chad were on a patrol in the Kidal Region when their convoy hit a roadside bomb. Mahamat Saleh Annadif said those responsible for what he called a cowardly terrorist act must be apprehended and put on trial. The UN mission, known as Minusma, has around 13 000 soldiers who, together with the French military, are trying to contain a jihadist insurgency which began in 2012. In recent years the violence has spread to neighbouring countries including Niger and Burkina Faso.
