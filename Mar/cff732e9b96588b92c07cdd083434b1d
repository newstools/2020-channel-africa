Reports say the governor of Nugal province, Abdisalan Hassan Hirsi, and a former regional police Commissioner, Farah Galangole, were attacked by a man wearing a suicide vest who approached their car in the Puntland capital of Garowe. The two men are receiving treatment in hospital. The al-Shabab Islamist group has claimed responsibility for the attack, which is a comparatively rare occurrence in Garowe.
