Ndindi Nyoro and Alice Wahome are accused of hiring people to instigate clashes between supporters of President Uhuru Kenyatta and those backing his deputy, William Ruto. Police Chief Hillary Mutyambai has also ordered that vehicles hired to "ferry goons" be tracked and detained to assist in investigations. Supporters of Kenyatta and those backing Ruto pelted each other with stones and burnt tyres outside a church in central Kenya. The police fired tear gas, some of which went into the church. The two leaders have fallen out, largely due to Ruto's intention to run for president in two yearsâ€™ time when Kenyatta steps down. --BBC--
