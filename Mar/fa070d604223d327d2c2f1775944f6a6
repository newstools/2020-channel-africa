Sundowns succumbed by two goals in the first-leg in Cairo on Saturday and now face a huge task to turn the tie around in Tshwane. Mosimane though remains optimistic that the Brazilians can score the three goals at home to advance in a match that takes place this Saturday. The Sundowns mentor said after the game in Egypt: "Two goals is a bit difficult for us to turn the results around but we have to turn the volume up in Pretoria, we don't have an option. We have to score in Pretoria but congratulations to Al Ahly, but we managed to deal with the pressure. "Come to Pretoria it's a different story there, ask other teams. It's totally a different game and I can't explain it." The South African outfit had chances to get a crucial away goal but Themba Zwane squandered their best opportunity in the first minute of the game. Mosimane added: "I'm crying for that opportunity in the first 20 seconds. We could be speaking a different story now. We didn't sit back, Al Ahly was pushing us back. I had to protect goals. The game would have been different if we didn't miss the chance in the first 20 seconds." Sundowns will take inspiration from the fact they beat the same opponents 5-0 in Tshwane last season.
