"The rand has been the worst performing emerging market currency over the past week and traded at its weakest level ever at R18.05($1.10) in Asia early this morning," said TreasuryONE in a note to clients on Monday morning.  "The local currency is 17% weaker over the past month'. Moody's on Friday night lowered SA's sovereign credit rating to the first rung of noninvestment grade, citing a deterioration in the country's fiscal strength, "structurally very weak growth", and little progress on structural reforms of the economy. By 07:50 on Monday the rand had recovered some of its losses to trade at R17.90($1) to the greenback. According to Bianca Botes of Peregrine Treasury Solutions, this was due, in part, to China’s central bank unexpectedly cutting interest rates by 20 basis points, which "assist[ed[ the rand in recovering some of its earlier losses". The local currency's previous weakest intraday level was R17.91/$ back in 2016, which was caused by a sharp fall in the Chinese market, as Fin24 previously reported. --news24--
