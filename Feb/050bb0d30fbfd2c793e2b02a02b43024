The project was launched in the presence of President Faure Gnassingbe and Hussain Al Nowais, chairman of AMEA Power which is in charge of designing, financing, building, launching, operating and maintaining the facility. The complex is West Africa’s largest ongoing solar PV project and supports Togo’s ambitions to increase its rural electrification rate to 50% by 2022 and 100% by 2030. “AMEA Power is a foreign investor who understands Africa and has demonstrated a commitment to supporting local content wherever it operates,” African Energy Chamber Executive Chairperson, NJ Ayuk, said. "As public and private sector interest for Africa grows in the Middle East, such players are most welcomed. Their work in and with Africa contributes to the development of a sustainable and prosperous future.” At the end of 2019, Saudi Arabia-based ACWA Power signed two long-term power purchase agreements for 250 megawatts of solar PV projects in Ethiopia, while state-owned ADNOC is reportedly looking at several investments into the African upstream oil and gas sector. --ANA--
