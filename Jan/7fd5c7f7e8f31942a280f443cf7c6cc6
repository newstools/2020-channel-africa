Police in Uganda say they were smuggled to Nairobi over the past three years to work as housemaids. The girls and women are being held at the headquarters of the Criminal Investigations Directorate in Kampala for background checks and counselling for trauma. Police say just under half of them are minors, some as young as 13 years old. A joint operation conducted by Ugandan and Kenyan authorities to rescue the group took place on Sunday in two suburbs of Nairobi. A Ugandan woman believed to be their trafficker is in detention in Nairobi. --BBC--
