The 29-year-old left-back was reported by the Daily Mail to have confronted Mourinho as he was unhappy at being left out of both the 2-1 win over Middlesbrough in the third round FA Cup replay last week and then for the Watford match. Youngster Japhet Tanganga played instead and won rave reviews for his performances. However, Mourinho said there was no issue between himself and Rose, who has also fallen out of favour with England manager Gareth Southgate. "No. Between me and Danny, no," said Mourinho at his press conference ahead of Wednesday's match with Premier League bottom side Norwich. "I don't know what you mean by tension in the air, I don't have a problem with him." Mourinho, whose side are eighth going into the match eight points adrift of Chelsea who occupy the fourth and final Champions League spot, said he left Rose out of the game after being told late on Thursday he had a back injury.
