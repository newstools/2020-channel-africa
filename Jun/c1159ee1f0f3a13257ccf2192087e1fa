Some 305 new infections in a 24-hour period were reported on Sunday, in a new record. Three weeks after easing lockdown restrictions, Algeria has registered a huge surge in new infections in the province of Setif and other eastern parts of the country. The authorities say it's because of people ignoring preventive measures, and President Tebboune has ordered severe punishments against the offenders. To date, Algeria has recorded 13,571 cases of the virus and 905 related deaths - among the highest on the continent. --BBC--
