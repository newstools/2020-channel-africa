World stocks were flat, pulled down by a 3% fall in Hong Kong, where trading resumed after the Lunar New Year holiday. But they stand just 2% off recent record highs following Tuesday’s recovery on Wall Street and gains across Europe. A pan-European equity index rose 0.5%, extending Tuesday’s 0.8% rise. Bank shares gained almost 1%, thanks to upbeat results from Spain’s Santander, and Swedbank a day earlier. Equity futures suggest a stronger open for US shares, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq up 0.5%. Tuesday’s rise was aided by robust earnings from Apple. Of the 104 US companies to report results so far, 68.3% have exceeded expectations, and earnings expectations for the quarter have been upgraded. “The numbers look pretty solid at the start of the earnings season,” said Neil Campling, an Equity Analyst at Mirabaud. “But there is obviously caution as further news comes out of China regarding the coronavirus.” The S&P 500 remains 3% below record highs. Investors are looking for earnings from 47 S&P 500 firms on Wednesday, including Facebook, Boeing, General Electric, Microsoft, McDonald’s and AT&T. Earlier, Chinese equity futures traded in Singapore rebounded from two days of losses to rise 1.79%, the biggest gain in almost seven weeks. Mainland markets remained shut. “There appears to be more transparency, communication in terms of the virus, and that makes it easier to start assessing the economic fallout. So the markets have taken some comfort from that,” said Rainer Guntermann, a Rates Strategist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt. He was comparing the coronavirus response with Beijing’s secretive stance during the 2003 outbreak of the SARS virus, which enabled it to spread faster and claim more victims. --Reuters--
