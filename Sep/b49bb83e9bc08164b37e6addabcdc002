The French champions on Monday said that two of their players had tested positive for the virus and gone into quarantine. “Three Paris Saint-Germain players have confirmed positive Sars Covid-19 tests and are subject to the appropriate health protocol,” the club said in a statement. “All of the players and coaching staff will continue to undergo tests in the coming days.”     

Although the Ligue one season has kicked off, PSG have yet to begin their campaign as they have been given a break following their run to last month’s Champions League final, where they were beaten 1-0 by Bayern Munich. The Parisian club start their title defence at Racing Lens on September 10.
