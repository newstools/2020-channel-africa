The Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF) says it is still receiving new TERS applications. Applications for March, April and May will close on September 25, applications for June will close on October 25, and applications for July to September 15 will close on October 30. With the country now recording a steady decline in new coronavirus infections, Ramaphosa has announced the moving of South Africa to level 1 lockdown. “More than 800 000 companies have benefited through the UIF wage support scheme and through the grants and loans provided by various government departments and public entities. More than 4 million workers have received R42 billion ($2.5 billion) in wage support, helping to protect these jobs even while companies were not able to operate. The UIF benefit has been extended until the end of the national state of disaster,” explains the President. Meanwhile in August, Labour and Employment Minister, Thulas  Nxesi, said there were many employers who have received UIF payments but have not paid their employees. Nxesi has given the undertaking that those who have not yet been paid will get their money. The UIF announced that it has resumed payment of its TERS benefits after payments were temporarily suspended. UIF Commissioner, Tebogo Maruping, says they felt that it was important to pause the system on the TERS as an assurance process took place within the organisation. The process involves management assurance, risk management, internal auditor, and finally the Auditor-General having a look at the system to check if there are any discrepancies in payments to beneficiaries. --SABCNews--
