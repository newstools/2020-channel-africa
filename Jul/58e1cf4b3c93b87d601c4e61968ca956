The EastAfrican has learnt that with only seven months to the expiry of the safeguards, Kenya has realised that having lobbied for an extension twice in the past, securing another could be a tall order and that the country cannot peg the survival of the sugar industry on protection from competition. "Kenya has not applied for an extension of the safeguards. If it will to do so, it must present the request at the meeting of the Comesa Trade and Customs Committee, which brings together technical experts from all member states," Mwangi Gakunga of the Comesa secretariat told The EastAfrican. The safeguards allow Kenya to limit duty-free imports from Comesa countries to a maximum of 350 000 metric tonnes annually because the country is unable to compete with other member states on a duty-free quota free terms. The government has, therefore, resolved to lease the factories hoping to turnaround the companies, which have collapsed under the weight of years of mismanagement, corruption and influx of cheap imports. The Agriculture and Food Authority (AFA) is looking for investors to enter into long-term leases for Chemilil, Nzoia and South Nyanza sugar companies alongside Miwani and Muhoroni sugar companies, both of which are under receivership. To make the factories attractive to investors, the government has restructured their balance sheets including writing off massive debts, tax waivers and penalties amounting to a staggering $572.5 million. Kenya's sugar production cost is estimated at more than $600 per metric tonne, twice that of other key sugar-producing Comesa countries, making the country an attractive export market. --TheEastAfrican--
