Aid group World Vision said another of its employees was seriously wounded, and two were kidnapped during Wednesday's attack on a convoy in Lubero in North Kivu Province. The organisation denounced the incident which it said was an attack on the most vulnerable children and communities the staff had been serving. A local official said the ambush was carried out by the militia known as the Mai-Mai which has been active in eastern DRC since the early 1990s. --BBC--
