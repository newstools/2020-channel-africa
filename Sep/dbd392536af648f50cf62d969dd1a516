Two 25-men squads have been chosen for the match. The two squads boast 13 members of the Rugby World Cup winning squad from last year in Japan. Coach Rassie Erasmus says most of the Boks have not played enough this year to be competitive enough for test rugby. He says they are now working hard to improve their conditioning to enable them to compete in the Rugby Championships in Australia in November. Erasmus says they are also still waiting for a few players who are based overseas to join the squad. “It’s more the English clubs that will be in the semi-finals and finals who we haven’t really got a clear answer from when their players will be available. The French clubs, I actually think, are aligned with us. So, I think it’s more the English clubs. Then arriving in Australia where the Rugby Championships will be hosted, you have to arrive at the same time and it will be a massive squad. You have to be there for eight weeks and quarantine is two weeks and those kind of things.” --SABC--
