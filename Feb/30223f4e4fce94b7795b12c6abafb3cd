The dual-axis steering (DAS) system raised plenty of eyebrows up and down the F1 paddock after it was debuted by Lewis Hamilton, and the conversations regarding it have not stopped since. Ricciardo, though, could only take his proverbial hat off to the consecutive six-time double World Champions as they continue to push the boundaries of the sport despite year upon year of continued success. Ricciardo told F1 TV: "Hats off to them because they have been dominant this whole turbo era yet they are still the ones pushing everyone else. It should be us and everyone else pushing them and they're not getting complacent. And I think that's why they've been so dominant. "So they're setting an example right now and as a competitor, I certainly respect that. And it's good for everyone to see how far they're willing to go. I think everyone up until now, I've never heard of a system that talked about, so I don't think maybe anyone had really thought about it. "I don't want to say anyone, but probably not many people talked about that. So I don't know if it was ever a conversation had, but I'm sure the conversation's happening in every team right now."
