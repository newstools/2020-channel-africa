Rashica has enjoyed a strong season for the Bundesliga outfit, scoring ten and assisting five goals before play was suspended, which has caught the eyes of several teams around Europe. Liverpool were one of those, and last week it was suggested that they were interested in signing the wide man, but it would appear he has now fallen down their list of targets. Southampton were also linked with the Kosovo international, but four other top flight clubs are now said to be in for his signature when they transfer window re-opens. According to the report, Wolves, West Ham, Aston Villa and Brighton have registered their interest and will compete to secure a deal for the 23-year-old ahead of next year. It is believed Rashica is open to making the move to England, although is likely to view the clubs listed as 'stepping stones' to a bigger side as he has serious ambitions of playing for one of Europe's biggest teams later in his career. The price tag may also be an issue, with the player having a â‚¬38 million release clause in his contract which may be more than most clubs can afford given the current situation with Covid-19. That clause must be triggered before the 15th June otherwise Werder will be able to negotiate a higher price for their top scorer, who still has two years left to run on his deal. There will be further competition from within Germany too, with Borussia Dortmund and RB Leipzig also considering bids. In fact, Leipzig are confident of securing a deal for Rashica, who they view as a replacement for Timo Werner should he complete a switch to Liverpool as expected. --NEWS24--
