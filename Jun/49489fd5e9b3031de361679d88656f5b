"I was told it was not possible," Colonel Tsege Alemayehu told BBC Tigrinya. Her husband, General Seare Mekonnen, was reportedly assassinated by his bodyguard as part of a plot to seize power in Amhara regional state in northern Ethiopia. The attack came hours after gunmen in Bahir Dar killed the governor of Amhara, Ambachew Mekonnen, along with two senior officials. Colonel Tsege said she had heard nothing but "speculation from social media" about her husband's killing. "A year ago I was told the suspect is under arrest. But I was not even called to give my testimony. I don’t know about what’s going on,’’ she said. "The whole year our hearts are broken, our house is dark," Colonel Tsege added. Abeba Zemichael, wife to the General Gezai Abera, who was killed alongside General Seare, expressed her frustrations as well. "The judicial process is null. Everyone is quiet on this. Both were great leaders. We are depressed and waiting for justice from God," she said. A memorial ceremony for the two generals is taking place in the northern region of Tigray, which is where they are from. To mark the anniversary the authorities in the capital, Addis Ababa, have named a street after Gen Seare. --BBC--
