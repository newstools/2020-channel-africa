The 36-year-old shot-stopper, who has been on the books of the Red Devils since 2010, is one of the most decorated Egyptian keepers of all-time. Ekramy is serving as Al Ahly’s second-choice goalkeeper behind Mohamed El Shenawy. The former Egypt international released the following statement on his official Twitter page: “Twenty-three years, they used to assume responsibility on the field, there is no joy in football than the fun of matches and participating in them bearing the Al-Ahly logo, and my goal during the last period was to try to return again to the pitch with hard effort and patience, waiting for a real opportunity, but day after day it becomes the most difficult reality”. “Every detail regarding my next step will be announced clearly when I settle on it and in a timely manner, all my focus now is with my team to achieve a successful last season that satisfies the aspirations of our large fans and perform faithfully until my last day,” a statement read. Ekramy had a spell with Dutch giants Feyenoord between 2005 and 2009. --AllAfrica--
