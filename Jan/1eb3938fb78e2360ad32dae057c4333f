The failed break-in at Laikipia, where the British army trains about 10 000 troops a year, was captured on a security camera. Three men were subsequently arrested at about 5 pm on Sunday and were being questioned by anti-terrorism officers, the police report said. It is not clear whether the attempt to break into the British base was connected to the attack on the Camp Simba base in Manda Bay that killed three Americans. Somali Islamist insurgent group al Shabaab claimed responsibility for that attack early on Sunday and posted pictures of fighters posing next to planes in flames. The deadly attack came only days after the United States said it was tightening security at its bases following threats from Iran to retaliate for a US airstrike that killed its most prominent military commander. The United States deployed additional military forces to Kenya on Monday to reinforce security at Manda Bay after Sunday’s attack, the military’s Africa Command said. Al Shabaab contacted media organizations, including Reuters, to stress that Sunday’s attack was not connected to Iran. “This Kenya attack has no connection with the Middle East attack. It is a fight between us and the US,” said Abdiasis Abu Musab, al Shabaab’s spokesperson for military operations.
