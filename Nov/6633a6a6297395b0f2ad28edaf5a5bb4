The planemaker’s shares jumped about 6% in early trading after the US Federal Aviation Administration chief Steve Dickson signed an order to allow the best-selling plane to resume flights following two fatal crashes that led to Boeing’s biggest crisis in decades. Meanwhile, Pfizer Inc said it would apply for emergency US authorization of its COVID-19 vaccine within days and disclosed final results from a late-stage trial that showed it was 95% effective. The company’s shares rose 3%. The announcement comes after Moderna Inc on Monday released preliminary data for its COVID-19 vaccine, showing similar effectiveness. At 07:05 am ET, Dow E-minis gained 0.45%, S&P 500 E-minis rose 0.3% and Nasdaq 100 E-minis were up 0.1%. “Whilst it doesn’t mean much for today (unlike last Monday), it does underscore the fact that we are heading into a much brighter 2021 and whilst temporary lockdowns need to be endured, the back-to-normal trade is still ‘on’,” said Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, referring to the muted market reaction to Pfizer’s update.
