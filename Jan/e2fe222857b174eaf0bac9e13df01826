Lebese had been linked with a possible return to Chiefs after he left Sundowns in September after a forgettable two-year stint that also involved a loan spell with SuperSport United. The 30-year-old has been without a club since September and admitted he was disappointed that he had received no offers for his services. However, 'Finidi George' has now been given a lifeline as he looks to get his career back on track. "George Lebese is here. He has arrived and is ready to get started," read a statement on the Switchbacks' official Twitter account.
