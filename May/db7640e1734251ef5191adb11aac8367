The two leaders agreed to form a technical body to complete the demarcation of the border between the two countries. Sudan recently called on Ethiopia to withdraw its troops from Al-Fashaga, a large agricultural area on the Sudanese side of the border, which has been under the control of Ethiopian gunmen for several years. On April 24, one Sudanese soldier was killed and three others wounded after an attack by Ethiopian gunmen in the Al-Fashaga area. --BBC--
