China’s National Health Commission said another 65 deaths were reported on Tuesday, a new daily record bringing the toll on the mainland to 490, mostly in and around the locked-down central city of Wuhan where the virus emerged late last year. There have been two deaths outside mainland China. A 39-year-old man in Hong Kong with an underlying illness who had visited Wuhan city died on Tuesday. A man died in the Philippines last week after visiting Wuhan, the first virus-related overseas fatality. Across mainland China, there were 3 887 new confirmed infections, bringing the total accumulated number to 24 324. Nearly 230 cases have been reported in 27 other countries and regions outside mainland China, according to a Reuters tally based on official statements from the authorities involved. “We have the ability and confidence to finally win this war of containment,” China’s State Councillor, Wang Yi, told Thailand’s Foreign Minister during a call on Tuesday, according to China’s Foreign Ministry. Wang said the mortality rate of less than 2.1% from the coronavirus outbreak to date was far lower than that of other major epidemics, the Foreign Ministry said in its account of the call published on Wednesday. The World Health Organisation has declared the flu-like virus a global emergency and experts say much is still unknown, including its exact mortality rate and transmission routes. --Reuters--
