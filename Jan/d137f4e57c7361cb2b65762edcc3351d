The South African men’s senior national football team have been pitted against neighbours Zimbabwe, East African side Ethiopia and West African giants Ghana in Group G. There are ten groups of four and only group winners proceed to the play-offs which will be played over two legs and the five winners will represent Africa in Qatar. Bafana were on the second spot in the seeding and head coach Molefi Ntseki believes that a passage to the play-offs is possible in this group. The World Cup qualifiers will start in October 2020 following the completion of the Afcon qualifiers, which will resume in March. History shows that Bafana have a poor record against Ghana in the qualifiers. They failed to qualify to the 2006 World Cup in Germany after losing both games against the Black Stars. They have also started poorly in the current 2021 African Cup of Nations (Afcon) qualifiers against Ghana losing 2-0 away. Ntseki doesn’t see this as a bad draw.
