It appears to have been tweeted first by a digital consultant who was taking part in Museveni’s six-day march through the jungle, which started on January 5. The President is retracing his forces' 1986 route, when they seized power after the fall of Milton Obote's government. The video shows people singing and banging a drum and the president sitting down and being handed a brown envelope from an aide. An old man then walks up and kneels in front of the president, who hands him the envelope. Two more elderly people follow and he gives them brown envelopes too. The commentary on the video doesn’t appear to criticise the situation, it just explains exactly who the President will and won’t give brown envelopes to. But less than an hour later, opposition leader Kizza Besigye, who is expected to stand against Museveni in the presidential election in 2021, retweeted the video saying it was humiliating to veterans. The video has continued to draw comment a day after it was originally tweeted. Another tweeter suggested the president was giving out the hand-outs to ensure people voted for him. A human rights lawyer tweeted that the video exposed the poverty of Uganda. Museveni did not tweet the video; his latest tweet thanks people who have joined him on the march. The President will end his march in the western town of Birembo, the site of one of the fiercest battles between Museveni's rebels and then-President Obote's troops, on January 10. --BBC--
