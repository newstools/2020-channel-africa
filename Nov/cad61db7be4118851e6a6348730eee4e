The virus is showing signs of a resurgence in parts of South Africa, the most badly affected country on the continent. After a long lull, infection rates are beginning to rise in some areas, particularly along the country’s southern coastline. Doctors in Cape Town and in Port Elizabeth are reporting a spike in hospital admissions. One provincial leader described the increase as staggering and said the virus was spreading widely, not just in a handful of hotspots. Concerns about a second wave are coinciding with nationwide protest action over low pay by community health workers, key figures in South Africa’s fight to contain the virus. The country is now heading towards its main summer holiday season, a time when millions of people travel. With the economy in deep trouble, the government is thought to be reluctant to reimpose tough lockdown restrictions. --BBC--
