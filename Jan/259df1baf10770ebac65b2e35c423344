It is understood that the ministry recently parcelled out “huge portions” of planted and unplanted land owned by Allied Timbers (Allied) to miners seeking to prospect for gold and diamonds and reports say their activities have already started decimating the forests. Allied, a state owned commercial enterprise, has a 99-year lease agreement with The Forestry Commission, which owns 60 % of commercial forest land in Zimbabwe. It was established following the unbundling of the commission in 2003, which was meant to separate regulatory activities from commercial activities. 

The intention was to enable both institutions to effectively pursue their mandates, with funds from the commercial wing supposed to assist in funding the regulatory functions. So the commercial wing gave rise to Forestry Company of Zimbabwe, later re-branded to Allied while regulatory activities were reconstituted into Forestry Commission. The latest development has heightened fears of accelerated destruction of timber plantations at a time when vast swathes of commercial forests are being massively destroyed by some illegal gold miners and veld fires often caused by illegal settlers. Manicaland produces the bulk of Zimbabwe’s timber requirements, but the industry is being undermined by some illegal artisanal gold mining as well as illegal settlers and recent development has potential to worsen the situation. In terms of the law, if a mineral is discovered on land already used for other purposes, mining takes precedence, meaning the owner of such land might be removed. This will, however, require the consent of the owner who also has first right of exploring that land. With regards to gazetted land, its use can’t be changed unless the President gives consent. “The ministry of Mines has issued grants to some companies, including the Zimbabwe Consolidated Diamond Company and individuals on planted and unplanted land owned by Allied,” said one source with knowledge of the matter.
