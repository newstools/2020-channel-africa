"Hi everyone. I can't wait to take part in the tournament in the magnificent city of Prague. See you in August," the reigning Wimbledon champion said in a video message posted by the event organisers. The Prague tournament runs from August 10-16. Halep will also play at the Palermo clay court event from August 3 in what will be the first WTA competition since professional tennis was suspended in mid-March due to the coronavirus. Halep has already hinted she will focus only on European events this year, wary of the health crisis in the United States which has left a question mark over the US Open in New York from August 31. Halep's commitment to the back-to-back clay court tournaments would hint at her focussing on the rescheduled French Open which gets under way in Paris on Â September 27. The Romanian won her first Grand Slam title at Roland Garros in 2018. --afp--
