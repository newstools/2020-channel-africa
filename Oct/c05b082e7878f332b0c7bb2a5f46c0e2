The election took place despite the federal government and electoral board announcing the postponement of all elections. Officials of the ruling party in the region, the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), subsequently said they do not recognise the federal government. A statement aired on Tuesday night by the state-run Ethiopian Broadcasting Corporation said the House of Federation "decided the federal government should sever any kind of relationship with the Tigray regional state assembly and the region's highest executive body". The federal government will however continue offering "basic services" to people in the region through local institutions. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's government has not responded to the statement. Ethiopia's delayed elections will be held by September 2021. --BBCâ€”
