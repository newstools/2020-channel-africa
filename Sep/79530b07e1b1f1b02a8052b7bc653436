Liverpool FC manager Jurgen Klopp has provided an update on the fitness of Matip. The towering central defender missed the Reds’ 2-0 victory at Chelsea in an English Premier League clash due to injury on Sunday. Matip has struggled with injuries at Liverpool having made just 10 appearances in the Premier League since the start of the 2019/20 season. Klopp disclosed that the 29-year-old will return from his injury after the upcoming FIFA international break. “With Joel, it could be slightly different. It’s not the worst thing in the world but a few weeks, a couple of weeks,” Klopp told the club’s official website. “Probably after the international break he will be ready again. So we have to see. It’s not cool. It’s crazy, in one day ‘bam bam’ but we have Fabinho and he played an exceptional game, so that was really, really nice.” The break will give Matip more time to recover from the injury as he has retired from international football. He played 27 international matches for Cameroon and netted once in the process.  --AfricaNews--
