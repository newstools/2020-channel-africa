The kingdom's third fixture on the premier motorbike racing calendar was slated for March 20-22, but the event was axed as the disease started spreading rapidly around the world. Officials have since gradually reopened the country's borders to business travellers and medical tourists, with some restrictions. Organisers are now eyeing a rescheduled race for November 21-22, said Deputy Government Spokesperson Traisuree Traisaranakul. "It depends on conditions like flights, the opening of airports and the readiness of the people" entering the country, she added. Thailand will also submit a bid to continue hosting MotoGP for five more years, Traisuree said. The sleepy northeastern city of Buriram hosted its first MotoGP race in 2018. Besides attracting thousands of motorsport fans to Thailand, it brought in $96 million each of the last two years it was held, according to official figures. --News24--
