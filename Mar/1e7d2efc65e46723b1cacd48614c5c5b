Noting that about 3 to 5 locust swarms are currently active in parts of the East African country, the ministry stressed that the desert locust situation "is very severe which needs intervention of several stakeholders including the international community," state-run Ethiopian News Agency (ENA) quoted officials at the ministry as saying on Thursday. As the country embarked on its second rainy season, the Ethiopian government is battling against time to control the spread of desert locust influx, in which the country has so far managed to spray chemical on 112 000 hectares of land infested by the desert locust swarms across different parts of the country. "The Ethiopian government is exerting maximum efforts to mobile resources from several stakeholders and partners in bid to protect the spread of locust swarms," Sani Redi, Ethiopian State Minister of Agriculture, said. According to the state minister, the locust is expected to upsurge in Ethiopia until the end of August, in which the situation could be further exacerbated by new swarm breeding, which may produce more locust swarms. The Ethiopian government, which has so far allocated $1 million funding in addition to financial pledges from its partners to support the prevention and controlling mechanisms in the coming months, also stressed that it's intensifying preventative and controlling measures with support from its international and bilateral partners, such as the government of China and the United Nations. The UN Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) pledged to support about $4.5 million and 220 000 litres of chemicals to help Ethiopia in tackling the desert locust swarms, according to Redi.  --TheEastAfrican--
