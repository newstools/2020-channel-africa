Thursday’s proceedings will wrap up the first phase of the extradition process and legal experts have said it could be years before a final decision is reached in the case, since Canada’s justice system allows many decisions to be appealed. On Wednesday, prosecutors argued that Meng should be extradited on fraud charges, and that contrary to her defence argument, the case is not solely about violation of the Unites States (US) sanctions against Iran. “Fraud, not sanctions violations is at the heart of this case,” prosecutor Robert Frater told the judge on Wednesday. Meng, 47, has said she is innocent and is fighting extradition. Although the courts had set aside two full days for the prosecution to present its case, the prosecution took only half of a day, and closed its arguments before lunch on Wednesday. The United States has charged Meng with bank fraud, and accused her of misleading HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA.L) about Huawei Technologies Co Ltd’s [HWT.UL] business in Iran.
