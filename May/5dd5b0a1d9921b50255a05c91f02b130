The Munich-based firm forecast its full-year automotive earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) margin to fall to 0% to 3%, versus the 2% to 4% range estimated before demand was decimated by government restrictions on movement worldwide aimed at slowing the coronavirus outbreak. “The BMW Group still expects the spread of the coronavirus and the necessary containment measures to seriously dampen demand across all major markets over the entire year 2020,” the automaker said. The carmaker reported a 133% rise in first-quarter profit to$1.50 billion . That compared with $638 million in the same period a year earlier, when the result was pulled down by a $2 billion provision. Its automotive EBIT margin rose to 1.3% from minus 1.6%. “Auto margin at clean 1.6% looks disappointing given the strength of mix,” Jefferies automotive analyst Philippe Houchois said in a client note on Wednesday.

BMW’s outlook is the latest sign that profitability at legacy automakers is on the wane, as they spend huge sums to clean up combustion engines in the face of increasingly stringent emissions regulations as well as rising competition from electric vehicle specialist Tesla Inc. Last week, Tesla said its automotive gross margin rose to 25.5% in the first quarter from 20.2% a year earlier, due to a 40% rise in deliveries, helped by demand for its Model Y crossover utility vehicle. --Reuters--
