Parliament rejected the draft constitution on Tuesday. A clause that prevented President Adama Barrow from resetting the clock to make him eligible for two more terms appears to have been the biggest sticking point. The United Democratic Party (UDP) leader, Ousainou Darboe, said the rejection of the draft was not a good sign for democracy. The next general elections are scheduled for next year. Darboe vowed to reintroduce the draft constitution if the opposition wins the elections. President Barrow came to power in 2016 - ending 22 years of dictatorship under Yahya Jammeh. --BBC--
