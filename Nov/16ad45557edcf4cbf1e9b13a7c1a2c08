OPEC+, a grouping comprising members of the of Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), plus Russia and others, had been due to ease production cuts from January 2021, but a second coronavirus wave has reduced demand for fuel around the world. OPEC+ is now considering rolling over existing cuts of 7.7 million barrels per day, or around 8% of global demand, into the first months of 2021, sources have said. Preliminary consultations on Sunday between the key ministers, including from OPEC’s leader Saudi Arabia and Russia, had not reached a compromise on the duration of the rollover. Sources have said talks were now focusing on extending cuts by three to four months, or on a gradual increase in output. Ideas of deeper cuts or a six-month rollover were much less likely, the sources said. “There is no consensus as yet,” one of the four sources said. A second source said: “There are many different ideas on the table... Also, a gradual increase (in production).” The main meeting was expected to begin at 1300 GMT on Monday. --Reuters--
