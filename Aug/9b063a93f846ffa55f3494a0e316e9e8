Imam Mahmoud Dicko became the figurehead for the protests, which started in June, calling for the resignation of President Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta. "The imam has made it very clear, he is not a candidate for anything. He wants the issues of bad governance to be addressed... We will not propose him and he will not accept to be president. He is not looking for any power," Soya Djike, an organiser of the long-running protests said. On Tuesday, mutinying soldiers stormed Keïta's residence and arrested the president and his prime minister. Keïta resigned that night on national television. However, the organising committee behind the protests says they were not party to the military's actions and are yet to talk to them about their plans. Djike, who is on the organising committee of the M5-RFP - which is the umbrella for all the protest movements - told BBC Focus on Africa that they had been asked to meet the military on Wednesday or Thursday. "It’s too early for us to say whether we are happy or not happy," he said. However, he made it clear that the protest movement did not want military rule. He also denied that the military's actions on Tuesday were a coup. "We condemn every military putsch but this was not a putsch because he [Keïta] resigned... You can’t really say that he resigned at gunpoint, you cannot see any guns," he added. --BBC--
