Its latest report on the country says it may also exacerbate weak productivity and regional disparities. The think tank warns another major negative impact on trade and jobs could come from a no-deal Brexit. The UK faced "prolonged" disruption and was at a critical juncture, it said. The think tank did, however, revise its estimate for the UK economy,the world's sixth largest, and now expects it to contract by 10.1% rather than the 11.5% it forecast in June. It is also expected to shrink in 2021, by, the OECD expects, 7.6% while unemployment will rise from its current 4.5% to 7.1%. The UK's economy shrank in the second quarter of the year by the most of any in the G7 leading nations. The OECD said Brexit would dampen that further, saying even a broad trade deal with the European Union would mean the UK economy ending up 4.2% smaller than if it had stayed in the bloc because of border checks and the cost of red tape for European Union workers.
 
The OECD, which is an economic organisation with 37 member countries, said the UK's strict lockdown was essential to contain the pandemic but halted activity in many key sectors.
