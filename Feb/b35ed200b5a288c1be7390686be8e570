The so-called “Libyan Joint Military Commission” includes five senior officers from eastern commander Khalifa Haftar’s Libyan National Army (LNA) and five officers aligned with the internationally recognized Government of National Accord (GNA). Haftar has been waging an offensive since April to take control of Tripoli, where the GNA is based. The fighting has displaced more than 150 000 people and drawn increasing involvement by foreign powers. The military talks were taking place two weeks after an international summit in Berlin that was focussed on charting a path toward a political solution and enforcing a UN arms embargo that has been routinely violated. Haftar has received material support from countries including the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Jordan, and Russia, according to UN experts and diplomats, while the government is backed militarily by Turkey. The LNA had delayed appointing representatives for the military talks, but appears to have come round to participating after Turkey supplied air defense systems that blunted the air advantage enjoyed by Haftar and his backers, diplomats said. Haftar’s offensive, which upended a previous UN peace plan, deepened the gulf between loose alliances that have competed for power from western and eastern Libya since 2014.
