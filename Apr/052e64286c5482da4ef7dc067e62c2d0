Eskom says it has put some generation units out of service. It adds that it anticipates demand to increase once the lockdown has been lifted. Exxaro Resources has confirmed that its subsidiary Exxaro Coal, had received letters calling force majeure on the coal supply agreements for the supply of coal to Eskom's Medupi and Matimba power stations. However Exxaro, which is one of Eskom's main coal suppliers, says it does not view a drop in demand as reason to declare force majeure as the power stations were still capable of supplying power.  --Reuters--
