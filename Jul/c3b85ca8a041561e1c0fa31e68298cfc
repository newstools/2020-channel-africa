Trump refuses to share documents concerning his fortune and business. His lawyers argue he enjoys total immunity while in office.

The ruling will test that claim and has implications on how far US lawmakers can scrutinise the President. 

Even a ruling in Congress's favour would not necessarily make Trump's tax returns public before his bid for re-election in November 2020. 

Trump, who made his money as a property developer, is the first president since Richard Nixon in the 1970s not to have made his tax returns public.     
He calls the investigation into his tax affairs a "witch hunt" and sees the congressional case as a device to harass him politically. Two Democrat-controlled House of Representatives committees and New York District Attorney Cyrus Vance, also a Democrat is demanding the release of his tax returns and other information.
