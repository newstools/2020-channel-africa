But according to the AFP news agency, the court said it was only conditional and that she could be extradited to Belgium over a child custody dispute. Traoré had been been ordered by a Belgian court to hand over her five-year-old daughter to her estranged former partner, a Belgian national. France said it had been acting on an arrest warrant from Belgium when it detained Traoré as she arrived at Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris on March 10. The Belgian warrant accused her of kidnapping and hostage-taking. According to French newspaper Le Monde, she has been on hunger strike in jail since her arrest.
