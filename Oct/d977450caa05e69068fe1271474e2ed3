The Ministry of Justice has requested that the immunity of Mohsen Belabes the leader of the Rally for Culture and Democracy (RCD) party be scrapped so that he can be prosecuted in a case involving a Moroccan worker who lost his life at a construction site owned by the MP. Belabes is accused of doing construction work at the site without a legal permit as well as employing a foreigner illegally. The ministry also wants former Public Works Minister Abdelkader Ouali to be stripped of his immunity. His name appeared in a corruption case involving jailed Prime Minister Abdelmalek Sellal and businessman Ali Haddad. Ouali is accused of granting a road construction project in the province of Chlef to the convicted businessman in breach of the law. Belabes and Ouali deny any wrongdoing. --BBC--
