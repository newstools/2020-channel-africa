Samancor and Glencore Merafe Joint Venture have served unions with Section 189 notices, indicating their intention to lay off some of their staff. They’ve cited increased production costs, electricity tariff hikes, pressure on commodity prices and the introduction of the carbon tax. NUM Regional Secretary, Geoffrey Moatshe, says this is unfair. “We are very disappointed with Samancor, the way they’re behaving lately, because they met with our national office, trying to seek advice as to how can we jointly try to avert the looming retrenchments. 

"But now surprisingly, we are served with Section 189 notice to come and consult. Then it can tell you, it’s a foregone conclusion, even when we go as a trade union to consult with them, that’s a foregone conclusion that workers are going to lose their jobs.”
