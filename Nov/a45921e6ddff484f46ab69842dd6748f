Militant Islamists linked to the Islamic State (IS) group have been carrying out gruesome attacks in the province since 2017. Macamo told the public broadcaster, Radio Mozambique, that all countries in the region need to get involved to curb the insurgency. She said the government will set up a centre for humanitarian assistance in Nampula province where people displaced by attacks in Cabo Delgado province have sought shelter. Up to 2,000 people have been killed and about 430,000 have been left homeless in the conflict. --BBC--
