“My king, my heart, my best friend. Happy 19th wedding anniversary baby,” she wrote on Instagram to accompany a photo of the couple. “I miss you so much. I wish you were here to hold me in your arms. I love you.” Basketball superstar Kobe and one of the couple’s daughters, 13-year-old Gianna, were among nine people killed in a helicopter crash in southern California on January 26. Kobe and Vanessa have three surviving daughters who were not on the helicopter. Kobe, a five-times NBA champion, was a fierce advocate for women’s basketball. He loomed large over the Women’s NBA draft on Friday, when Commissioner Cathy Engelbert announced the new Kobe & Gigi Bryant WNBA Advocacy Award. --Reuters--
