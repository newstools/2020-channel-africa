The patient is an Italian citizen who works in Nigeria and flew into the commercial city of Lagos from Milan on 25 February. Authorities say he is clinically stable and is being treated at a hospital in the city. It was the first confirmed case of the coronavirus in sub-Saharan Africa. Algeria and Egypt have also confirmed cases of the disease. Globally, more than 80 000 people in nearly 50 countries have been infected. Nearly 2 800 have died, the vast majority in China's Hubei province. Buhari has urged citizens to "refrain from panic" adding that "undue alarm would cause more harm than good". A statement from his office lauded the Ministry of Health, the Centre for Disease Control and state governments for their response after the first case was confirmed on Friday. The health ministry said that it had activated its response programme that had been prepared to ensure any outbreak of the virus is "controlled and contained quickly". So far all the people who were in contact with the Italian citizen have been traced and follow-ups made. Buhari told Nigerians to only trust information provided by the government and the World Health Organisation and follow the advisories to prevent infections. The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) will be publishing daily reports with updates on the coronavirus cases and response acroos the country, he said. --BBC--
