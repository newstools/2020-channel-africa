He said there had been “violations” of a peace agreement and a “lack of political will” from some parties. But he insisted his party, the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement in Opposition (SPLM-IO), was committed to its implementation. “These violations are a clear demonstration of lack of political will and commitment to implementation of transitional security arrangements. Despite the slow progress in the implementation of the agreement, we are optimistic and, I repeat, we are optimistic that peace shall prevail.” Machar, told the delegates during the opening of the sixth national conference of SPLM-IO in the capital, Juba, on Tuesday. Machar told members of his party to prepare for elections at the end of the transitional period. He also urged President Salva Kiir to re-commit to the implementation of peace agreement they both signed. Machar and his main political rival, Kiir, formed a unity government in February after six years of conflict, which saw thousands killed and millions displaced from their homes. --BBC--
