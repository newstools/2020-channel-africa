Final year students in primary and secondary schools resumed learning on Monday. A video showing schoolgirls queuing to be sprayed was posted on Twitter by a local newspaper sparking uproar. The ministry's administrative secretary, Rashid Aman, said the chemicals used were not suitable for human beings. He said the ministry would direct schools not to spray students. The World Health Organization guidelines do not recommend the spraying of individuals as it is harmful to their health. --BBC--
