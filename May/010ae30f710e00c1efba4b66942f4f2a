Farmers started selling their tobacco crop after the outbreak delayed the opening of auctions, which provide vital foreign currency inflows. Coming a month later than usual, farmers, who produced an all-time high of 259 million kilograms of tobacco last year, sell their crop to tobacco merchants, who process the crop for export. Chido Nyakudya, Chief Executive Officer(CEO) of Boka Tobacco Floors admitted the odd nature of the 2020 season saying, “It’s a different season, not like the one we’re used to. The season started later than usual. There is obviously some anxiety about the way things are going to go.” Tobacco is Zimbabwe’s second biggest earner of foreign exchange after gold. Last year, it generated $747 million in exports mainly to China and Europe, according to central bank data. --AfricaNews--
