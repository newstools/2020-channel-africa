Ambassador Mhishi was speaking at the on-going investment conference in Perth, Africa Down Under (ADU), which brings investors scouting for opportunities in Africa under one roof. ADU prides itself with delivering a leading forum for Australia-Africa business relations and having been introduced to raise awareness of Australia’s interests in African mining and energy. It has now grown to become arguably the largest African-focused mining event held outside the continent itself, and its importance continues to be reflected in the number of high-profile attendees. With its vast but largely under exploited mining sector potential, Zimbabwe is one of the major investment green shoots on the continent, which investors are taking a keen interest in and this has been further boosted by President Mnangagwa’s “Zimbabwe is open for business” drive. It is against this background that Ambassador Mhishi sought to woo Australian investors to the country with an impressive pitch. The envoy, in line with the Government’s economic diplomacy thrust, told the investors that Zimbabwe is currently pursuing a 2023 mining sector milestone which seeks to grow mining exports to $12 billion annually but there is potential of surpassing this target. --Herald--
