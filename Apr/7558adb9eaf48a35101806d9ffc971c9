In a media briefing on Tuesday, US President, Donald Trump, announced he was halting funding to WHO, citing "mismanaging" of the global coronavirus pandemic. The US is one of the global health organisation's leading donors. Trump has been critical of the WHO, saying that it favoured China, which he said only paid 40 million dollars toward it. The South African government, through the Department of International Relations and Co-operation, said it was very "concerned" and "alarmed" by the announcement. Meanwhile, South Africa’s opposition party, the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has condemned Trump’s move on the, saying it is wrong to make such a move in the midst of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. EFF National Spokesperson, Vuyani Pambo, says this decision highlights Trump’s deep disdain for human life. He says the actions are not only a direct attack on the health of other nations, but a threat to the livelihood of US citizens. The EFF has called on Trump to reconsider his decision. Meanwhile, WHO Director-General, Tedros Ghebreyesus, on Wednesday said they regret the decision by Trump to suspend funding for the organisation. Ghebreyesus says the WHO is making plans to fill any financial gaps that may result from Trump’s decision. “We regret the decision of the president of the US to order a halt in funding to the WHO. --AllAfrica/Reuters--
