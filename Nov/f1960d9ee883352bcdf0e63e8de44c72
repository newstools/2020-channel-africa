This comes after the services, trading and distribution company reported a 19.9% decline in profits for the year to end June, hurt by a Covid-19 outbreak resulting in a $840 million cost to its operation during the year. Bidvest said on Friday that since the start of the financial year the monthly operational performance of the group had improved sequentially due to market share gains in several businesses, the PHS Group acquisition, exposure to certain growth segments and exceptional cost discipline. “Revenue and trading profit delivered in the first four months of financial year 2021 was broadly unchanged relative to the same period last year. “This, despite negative economic growth, low business and consumer confidence in all operating territories and travel and tourism-related industries, which remained closed,” the group said. “I am immensely proud of the Bidvest family. We prioritised the health and well-being of our employees in the face of the continued pandemic, maintained a healthy financial position through strong cash generation, and digested the significant PHS acquisition while delivering value-added services and products into a changed operating environment. “The future remains uncertain, but the group is resilient, agile and futurefit,” Madisa said. --IOL--
