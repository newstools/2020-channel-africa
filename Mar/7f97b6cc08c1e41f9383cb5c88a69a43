Mthethwa says given the sponsorship and broadcasting commitments of the league and also the need to spread the message against this pandemic, the league can continue with their programme behind closed doors. 

The decision to give the PSL the go-ahead with their programme behind closed doors is also proving to be unpopular with the public. Mthethwa had also earlier commended the PSL for introducing ideas like not shaking of hands before the start of the game. 
But vehemently opposed to this idea of playing behind closed doors is South African Football Association President 

Dr. Danny Jordaan, who still feels that it’s not safe and he counts the stories of Mikel Arteta, the Arsenal Manager and Spanish giants Valencia where 35% of their team contracted the coronavirus. Jordaan says he will be meeting PSL Chairperson, Dr Irvin Khoza, on Wednesday where they will be deliberating on this issue.
