The police had to be called in to break up supporters of President FÃ©lix Tshisekedi and those backing the previous head of state, Joseph Kabila. Three people were hurt as the rival groups flung objects at each other, AFP news agency says. Tear gas had to be used to disperse the crowds outside the building in the capital, Kinshasa. The violence comes after Tshisekedi set out his plan on Sunday to break months of political deadlock with supporters of Kabila. In a televised address, he said he would appoint an official to build a new coalition majority in the national assembly, which is dominated by his predecessor's followers. He said he was prepared to dissolve the assembly altogether if necessary. --BBC--
