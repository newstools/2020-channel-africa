The policeman, who identified himself in the video as Sergeant Jason Chipepo, announced his resignation last Thursday "to take responsibility on what is happening in Zambia". He claimed to have "a lot of questions that people have not answered" despite his numerous letters to them. They included why political parties are allowed to have their own parallel security, and mentioned the ruling Patriotic Front party as well as opposition parties. Zambia's police spokesperson Esther Katongo is quoted as saying the policeman last reported for duty on February 2, 2020, and is wanted for desertion. She said they have not received communication of his resignation. --BBC--
