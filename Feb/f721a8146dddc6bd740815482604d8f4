The bearded French eighth seed appeared all but finished as Croatian Cilic served for a straight sets win leading 5-3 in the second set after taking the first. But Paire broke as he clung on and then won the set in the opening match of the day played in 29C desert conditions. "It was not easy today. I was not confident before the match. Normally when it's one set, 5-3, I normally tank," Paire said. "This time I tried until the end. It was working good. I am really happy about the win. "I was not feeling really good on court. I was a little bit sick (the last) two, three days. But I was happy to win today and to fight until the end." Paire, who lost to Cilic at the second round of last month's Australian Open, recovered from a break down in the final set and saved match points in the 12 game to take it into a tiebreaker. Paire was untouchable, sprinting to five match points and converting on the second as Cilic double-faulted for a 10 time.
