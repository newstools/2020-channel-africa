The exhibition, featuring more than 150 items, is co-produced by the government in Cairo and the American company, IMG. The BBC has found that a deal between the two parties was struck when Egyptian law prohibited the loan of antiquities to projects involving commercial organisations. The ban was reversed in 2018. IMG said the deal was agreed by Egypt's prime minister. The artefacts are currently in London. They have previously been displayed in Los Angeles and Paris. --BBC--
