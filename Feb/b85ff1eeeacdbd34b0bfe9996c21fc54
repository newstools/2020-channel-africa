This despite the two clubs being locked in a battle over the legitimacy of the 26-year-old's transfer since September. Since Wednesday's draw there have been some threatening comments aimed at Malango, who at the moment only has temporary clearance from Fifa to play for the Moroccan club, on social media. "The situation and the decision are still in the hands of the Fifa. We are waiting their final verdict," Malango's agent, Faustino Mukandila, told BBC Sport. "Ben is not worrying. He did nothing wrong and got no problem with anyone in Congo. He is free to go anywhere he wants." "He is a professional player for Raja and travelling is part of his duties. Now Caf, Fifa and the Morocco Football Federation need to ensure the safety of the player. We will not accept any bullying or physical aggression towards him or Raja fans and officials who will be travelling to Congo." Malango has become a firm favourite with Raja's fans with eight goals and four assists in his 23 appearances so far. His popularity boosted by an extra-time goal against their arch-rivals, Wydad, in the Arab Club Championship Cup that meant the game ended 4-4 and 5-5 on aggregate, with Raja winning on the away goals rule. Raja is due to host Mazembe on 28 February with the return leg set for Lubumbashi a week later. --BBC--
