The latest merger was last week when KCB Bank signed a deal with Atlas Mara Ltd and ABC Holding Ltd to acquire BancABC. This year has also seen several other mergers of banks to form stronger financial institutions - including the merger between Commercial Bank of Africa Tanzania Ltd (CBA) and NIC Bank Tanzania Ltd (2020) to form NCBA Bank. The government-owned TIB Corporate Bank Ltd was also merged with TPB Bank. During the year, three smaller banks – Mwanga Community Bank Ltd, Hakika Microfinance Bank Ltd and EFC Microfinance Bank Ltd were merged to form a new micro-finance bank known as Mwanga Hakika Microfinance Bank Ltd. Industry experts say Tanzania need stronger lenders that will support the country’s economic growth and development by providing required financial services. “The new established banks after merging will be able to improve provision of loans due to enhanced level of capital as well as being able to reach more client due to expanded network through increased number of branches and alternative banking channels such as agent banking, ATMs, mobile money transfer,” said the Bank of Tanzania manager for banking supervision, Sadati Musa. According to him, the merged institutions have the opportunity to improve skills and service delivery and ultimately improve service to customers. “Our market currently faces shortage of banking skills, as such these mergers enable pooling together available skills to enhance quality of service delivery,” he stressed. Musa said the merging of banks helps the provision of diversified services under one roof, citing an example of TPB Bank which extended from retail services to corporate banking after merging with TIB Corporate Bank. However, he noted that if not well managed, the merging of the banks may increase cost to its customers due possibility of monopoly creation. The reduced competition can affect pricing of products or services and reduce the quality of services offered. --TheCitizen--
