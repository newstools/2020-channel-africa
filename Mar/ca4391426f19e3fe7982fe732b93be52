Critics said the vote was a ploy by President Alpha Condé to stay in power beyond his mandate. The deaths occurred in the capital, Conakry, where police fired tear gas to disperse demonstrators. Opposition supporters attacked the police, burned polling centres and destroyed voting equipment. Condé, 82, insists the new constitution will bring about positive reforms, especially for women. Many people say they are worried about the vote taking place during the coronavirus outbreak. More than 30 people have been killed in months of opposition protests against the referendum.
