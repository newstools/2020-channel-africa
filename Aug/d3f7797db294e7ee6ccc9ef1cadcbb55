The 30-year-old left the top flight last summer when his contract at Anfield expired but his move to Turkey's Trabzonspor was cut short in March when his deal was terminated after he received a four-month ban for breaching the Football Association's gambling regulations. Because of the coronavirus pandemic Sturridge had not actually missed that much football and so is not too far behind his peers in terms of fitness, having based himself in Los Angeles to continue his training. He has had offers from overseas clubs but is prioritising a return to England. "We have options around the world but I'm an English player and I've always loved playing in the Premier League," he told Sky Sports. "I believe I've got a lot to give to the Premier League and I would say that's my first choice. I do feel I have unfinished business so I would like to go back and play there. I'm open to playing in other leagues, it's not just the Premier League I'm going to consider, but to come back to England and give my best would be a huge option for me. "I'm very excited, I'm hungrier than ever and I'm totally focused on the next chapter." --News24--
