The SA Reserve Bank (SARB) said on Tuesday the total gross loan debt of the national government had increased by 20.3% year-on-year to $250 billion as at September 30. This was an equivalent of 75.2% of gross domestic product (GDP) and was inching closer to the total gross loan debt forecast of 81.8% of GDP by the end of fiscal 2020/21. In October, Finance Minister Tito Mboweni warned that the stock of gross debt would rise from roughly $270 billion this year and to $370 billion in 2023/24. The SARB’s Quarterly Bulletin showed capital outflows on South Africa’s financial account of the balance of payments grew larger to $2.6 billion in the third quarter following a revised outflow of $1.6 billion in the second quarter. SARB said the preliminary non-financial public sector borrowing requirement had doubled to $25 billion in the first six months of fiscal 2020/21, compared with the same period of the previous fiscal year. “This reflected the significantly larger cash deficits of both national government due to continued revenue shortfalls and the social security funds due to Covid-19 relief payments,” it said. In April, the government announced a $33.9 billion stimulus package with $8.8 billion coming from a reprioritisation of the budget. The rest of the funds were raised from local sources, as well as from global partners and international finance institutions. --IOL--
