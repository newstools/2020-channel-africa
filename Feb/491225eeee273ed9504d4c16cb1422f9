EU Foreign Ministers agreed on Monday to a naval mission that will be authorised to intervene to stop weapons shipments into the North African state. "Whoever can help in monitoring the arms embargo is welcome in whatever part of Libya," UN Libya envoy, Ghassan Salame, told reporters. "What is needed is that member states of the UN come to the rescue ... in monitoring the violations of the arms embargo, otherwise it will not end," he said. Salame said the embargo was being violated by air, land and sea, pointing to Libya's large and porous border. The UN envoy on Tuesday began hosting a second round of talks in Geneva to attempt to turn a shaky truce between the UN-recognised government in Tripoli and eastern-based military commander, Khalifa Haftar, into a lasting ceasefire. States including Russia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt support Haftar, while the UN-recognised government led by Fayez al-Sarraj is backed by Turkey and Qatar. Five senior officers from the Government of National Accord (GNA) and five appointed by Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA) were taking part in the talks, part of broader efforts to end the conflict in the country. Salame said he was meeting with the two sides separately but did not rule out possible joint talks at a later date. A first round of the talks ended with no result earlier this month but Salame said there was "more hope" this time, mainly because of the approval of a UN Security Council resolution calling for a "lasting ceasefire". World leaders had agreed at a Berlin summit last month to end all meddling in the conflict and stop the flow of weapons, but little has changed on the ground since then. Salame said the truce was "very fragile" but "nobody has so far reneged on the principle of accepting the truce". He said agreeing a ceasefire was "not a precondition" for talks planned to start in Geneva on February 26 on finding a political solution to the long-running conflict. --News24--
