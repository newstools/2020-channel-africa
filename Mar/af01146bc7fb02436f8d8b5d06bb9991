The man worked as a domestic worker for the country's first patient, a government official who arrived in the country last week from Switzerland. Nathaniel Blama, the head of Environmental Protection Agency, has since been suspended by President George Weah for allegedly refusing to follow health protocols. Blama denies the accusations. The authorities are working to trace people who had contact with Blama and his domestic worker who has been named as Johnny Phillips, a statement from the ministry of information said.
