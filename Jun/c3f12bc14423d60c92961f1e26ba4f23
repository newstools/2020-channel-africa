In the space of less than 24 hours, insurance marketplace Lloyd’s of London, insurer Aviva, and pub company Greene King apologised for their connection to the slave trade in the 18th and 19th centuries, while a college at Oxford University recommended the removal of a statue of colonialist Cecil Rhodes after years of criticism. Britain has been confronting some of its most brutal and shameful history after marches by Black Lives Matter throughout the country. 

The BLM movement has particular resonance in the UK, with its track record of colonizing swaths of Africa and the Caribbean and its central role in the global slave trade. Lloyd’s of London said Wednesday that it would offer unspecified financial support for charities and organisations promoting inclusion and it would also step up efforts to hire more Black and racially diverse talent. Greene King, owned by billionaire Li Ka-shing’s real-estate company CK Asset Holdings, said it was inexcusable that one of its founders profited from slavery and argued against its abolition in the 1800s. Benjamin Greene was one of 47 000 people that received compensation from the government for their slave-related assets when the institution was abolished in 1833, the Telegraph reported. Greene surrendered three plantations in the West Indies and received the equivalent of $622 000 in today’s money, the paper said. --News24--
