The manufacturers, including the Beer Association of South Africa, say they will request municipalities and provincial local authorities of liquor businesses for the details. The move comes after Tourism Minister Mmamoloko Kubayi-Ngubane appealed to restaurants to comply with alert level two lockdown regulations following numerous complaints. The association’s CEO Patricia Pillay says they are concerned about increasing incidents of non-compliance in areas such as Ekurhuleni. “The one that we’ve followed on is the reported one by the Ekurhuleni Metro Police Department (EMPD). There were more than 100 cases of non-compliance that were reported. We did follow up with them and they did say that they were dealing with them.” “Unfortunately they have not furnished us with names and details. We are wanting to follow up the details directly and speak to them about their reasons for non-compliance and how we could support them,” adds Pillay.
