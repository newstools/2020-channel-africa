Earlier in January, transport and logistics company, Ziegler, filed an urgent court application to place SA Express under business rescue, in an effort to recover around $760 million it says the airline owes it for services rendered. The ruling was made by the Johannesburg High Court this Thursday. While SA Express and South African Airways (SAA) are both State-owned airlines, they are distinct businesses. SAA was placed into voluntary business rescue in early December. Connie Mulder of Solidarity told Fin24 that the ruling was important, as it showed that State-owned entities were subject to the Companies Act. Richard Mantu, a spokesperson of the Department of Public Enterprises, says a statement may be issued about the ruling later today. 

Fin24 has contacted SA Express for comment. --News24--
