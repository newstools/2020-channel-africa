The Antonov 12 plane crashed five minutes after taking off from El-Geneina, killing its crew of seven as well as three judges and eight other civilians, including four children, the statement said. The cause of the crash is being investigated. El-Geneina, which is the capital of West Darfur and lies close to Sudanâ€™s border with Chad, has seen deadly clashes between ethnic groups in recent days. There is a heavy military presence around the city, which has received security reinforcements and visits by senior officials this week.
