The law allows for transfer of functions between the national government and county governments after an agreement. Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko on Tuesday handed over control of transport, health, public works and planning functions. He signed the agreement in the presence of President Kenyatta at State House. Governor Sonko is facing corruption charges and has been barred from accessing his office until his case is heard. He is accused of irregularly awarding tenders to his close aides, forging documents and misappropriating county funds. He denies any wrongdoing. Nairobi county lawmakers are also expected to debate a motion to impeach him, which was tabled in the local assembly last week. The agreement for the national government to take over the functions of the county government has attracted criticism, with some saying it is unconstitutional. A lawyer told Kenya's Star newspaper that the decision should have been made after consultations with the count assembly and city residents. Kipchumba Murkomen, the senate's majority leader, said the transfer of functions would be debated in the upper chamber of parliament on Wednesday because it was a "weighty matter that requires deep deflection".
