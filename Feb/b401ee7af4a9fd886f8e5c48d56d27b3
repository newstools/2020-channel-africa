The fund on Wednesday revised its 2020 growth projection for Zimbabwe from 2.7% to just 0.8%. The Zimbabwean government, meanwhile, expects growth of 3%. In January, the IMF also revised down its growth projection for South Africa to 0.8%. This revision depressed projected growth for the sub-Saharan Africa region, as Fin24 reported at the time. In its Article IV Consultation with Zimbabwe, the global lender said the southern African country was facing an economic and humanitarian crisis exacerbated by policy missteps and climate-related shocks. "With another poor harvest expected, growth in 2020 is projected at near zero, with food shortages continuing," it said. The review comes as the recently reintroduced Zimbabwe dollar has lost much of its value. Hyperinflation hit Zimbabwe in October, according to the Public Accountants and Auditors Board, following rampant price increases, including a 300% increase in the electricity tariff. In addition to high inflation and low international reserves, the IMF said there was a need to address governance and corruption challenges, entrenched vested interests, and enforcement of the rule of law to improve the business climate and support private sector-led inclusive growth.
