The talks were due to take place on Saturday but were postponed due to disagreements with the M5-RFP group which led the massive protests against the former President Ibrahim Boubacar Ke√Øta. He was overthrown almost a fortnight ago. M5-RFP insists it is given an equal role to the military during the transition period. West African leaders have called for an immediate return to constitutional order but the military says the transition will last at least two years. --BBC--
