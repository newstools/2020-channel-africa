Minister of Sport, Nathi Mthethwa, revealed on Saturday, May 30 that contact sports can resume training under Level 3 of the national lockdown, which started on Monday, June 1. However, professional matches will not take place as sporting bodies and government continue discussions for when domestic clashes can resume. SAFA acting Chief Executive Officer, Tebogo Motlanthe has urged the South African public to stop playing social football matches in parks and in the streets across the country. "We have received numerous complaints from across the country where some people are still playing football, mostly social games," said Motlanthe in a statement released by SAFA. "This is illegal and unacceptable under COVID-19 regulations. No football is allowed to be played and this regulation applies across the board. All clubs and individuals are requested not to breach the government COVID-19 lockdown rules. "Everything is on hold as things stand and we must all await government instructions on the way forward. In the meantime, players must stay at home, obey COVID-19 regulations such as social distancing, and maintaining strict hygienic rules," added Motlanthe. --Sport24--
