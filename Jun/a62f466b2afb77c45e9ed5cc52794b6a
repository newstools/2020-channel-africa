Violence has erupted in cities across the US sparked by the death in police custody of African-American George Floyd. US National Security Adviser Robert Oâ€™Brien, in an interview with American broadcaster ABC, had said foreign adversaries were taking advantage of the ongoing protests and mentioned Zimbabwe and China. O'Brien said that he had seen tweets from Chinese who were "taking pleasure and solace in the chaos in America", but did not provide details on Zimbabwe's alleged role to the protests. But he said all foreign adversaries involved would not "get away with it". In response, Zimbabwe's Foreign Minister Sibusiso Moyo is quoted by state-owned Herald newspaper as saying that the US ambassador was expected to honour the summon over the remarks, but gave no details of when the meeting will be held. He said the government intends to remind the ambassador that Zimbabwe respects the sovereignty of other nations. Secretary for Information Nick Mangwana tweeted that the country does not consider itself America's adversary.
