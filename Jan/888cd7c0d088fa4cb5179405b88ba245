Tsitsipas became the youngest player to beat Rafael Nadal on clay and the youngest to record wins over Nadal, Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic during a stellar 2019 which saw him rise to world number five. The 21-year-old heads into the inaugural ATP Cup ranked sixth, but said he was confident he could go all the way to the top. "I mean, yeah, they are still there -- they are doing really well," Tsitsipas said about Nadal, Federer and Djokovic. "For me, it's very challenging to go out there and compete against them. "I feel like there's something extra to chase after when I play against them, plus I get to learn a lot when I play against them. "I feel more of a complete player," he added. "I kind of compare them to me to see what works for them and what should I work on more, and they're just super humans in a way. "But I'm trying to get there myself and I'm going to keep trying to do my best because I feel like I can surpass them, I can be better. "It's just a matter of time, patience, and dedication on what I do." Tsitsipas said he was in top shape heading into the new season and said he was playing pain free. But he conceded he needed to work on his consistency across tournaments.
