At a London launch event for the COP26 talks, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged “every country to announce credible targets to get there”, referring to the Paris Agreement goal of countries becoming carbon-neutral to limit global warming. “I hope that we can as a planet and as a community of nations get to net zero within decades. We’re going to do it by 2050, we’re setting the pace, I hope everybody will come with us,” he added. Britain has enshrined in law its 2050 net-zero targets, the first G7 country to do so. Achieving the target would mean Britain would produce no more greenhouse gas emissions than it could offset by planting trees and taking other measures to remove carbon from the atmosphere, or by paying for reductions elsewhere. Nick Molho, Executive Director of the Aldersgate Group, an economic sustainability alliance that includes some of Britain’s biggest businesses, said the government needed to align its national and international policy agendas on climate change to maximise its influence at the COP26 conference. “In practice, this means publishing a policy plan well ahead of the summit, setting out how the United Kingdom will put itself on a credible track to achieve its net-zero emissions target,” he said.
