State spokesperson, Melese Beyene, has told the BBC that the violence was a "conflict among individuals" and that arrests were made.Â 

But a senior official from the opposition National Movement of the Amhara, Desalegn Chane, told the BBC that the violence was a continuation of ethnic-related attacks against minorities. He said the number of fatalities could be as high as 18. Last week officials from the region said 14 civilians were killed during attacks. Fourteen others who were alleged perpetrators of the attacks were also killed. The region has witnessed a surge in violence in the past few months with ethnic Amhara and Agew minorities being targeted. --BBC--
