It says that during talks with Ethiopia's Foreign Minister Demeke Mekonnen "President Museveni advised that, immediate negotiations must come into place to see to it that the war is not prolonged as it might lead to massive loss of lives and dwindling of the economy". Museveni also said that "because Ethiopia was one of the oldest countries in Africa and had never been colonised, it had an image to keep since it represents the whole of Africa". The Ethiopian government is opposed to negotiations with the TPLF saying that "any mediation effort will incentivise impunity and unruliness". --BBC--
