This brings the total amount of donations to $40 million over the past couple of months. FAO had appealed for $76 million, needed by March, to fully control the locust invasion. However, the United Nations (UN) agency said it will still take almost $138 million for rapid response and anticipatory action in eight countries on the continent FAO Director-General, Qu Dongyu, while addressing donors in New York warned that the locust invasion could trigger a humanitarian crisis. He said FAO had so far received around $22 million of the $76 million requested to assist the five countries initially impacted. But he expected needs to increase amid concern that the outbreak will continue to spread to other countries. “It is clear that already vulnerable populations could easily be pushed into a major humanitarian crisis unless we act fast to protect their livelihoods,” Qu said. On Monday, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation committed $10 million. “The foundation’s support is intended to help FAO and national governments confront the critical need for rapid control of the infestation, including aerial control of large swarms,” said a press release by the Foundation. Earlier, the Unites States Agency for International Development (USAid) announced that it would provide $8 million to be used in efforts in Kenya, Ethiopia and Somalia, the countries most affected. Other countries and organisations that have donated towards the crisis include the European Union, Germany, Belgium, Sweden, Denmark, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Switzerland, and the UN Central Emergency Response Fund for their aid contributions. The money will be channelled through FAO to support its work with the respective governments. --TheEastAfrican--
