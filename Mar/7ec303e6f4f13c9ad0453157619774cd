The FTSE 100 index of top UK firms fell more than 3%, with aerospace, travel and housing firm among the hardest hit. The pound meanwhile fell to its lowest level against the dollar in over three decades, trading at $1.18. The US on Tuesday outlined a $1 trillion package to support the world's biggest economy. UK chancellor Rishi Sunak also revealed a £350 billion ($411 billion)stimulus package for UK firms, including £330 billion ($388 million) of business loan guarantees. It also included aid to cover a business rates holiday and grants for retailers and pubs. Help for airlines are also being considered. Sunak told a news conference: "Never in peacetime have had we faced an economic fight like this one." The stimulus measures taken globally also failed to buoy Asian stocks.

In Japan Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is reportedly forming a panel of key economic ministers and Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda to discuss measures to prop up the economy. The move, which would bring Japan in line with other nations, is designed to avert an economic crisis in the country, which some fear could tip into recession. --BBC--
