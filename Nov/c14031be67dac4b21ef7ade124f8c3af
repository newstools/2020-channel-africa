In a statement, the President described the allegations as “errors of fact”. The statement added that neither the president nor any member of his government interfered with Amidu's work and adequate resources were made available to enable him to do his work efficiently and effectively. Amidu resigned as Ghana’s anti-corruption Chief on Monday, citing among other things interference by President Akufo-Addo. Amidu's appointment two years ago was greeted with high expectations as he was seen by many in Ghana as the right man to fight corruption among public officials. His resignation comes less than three weeks before the general election, in a country where promises to deal with corruption feature prominently during electioneering campaigns.
