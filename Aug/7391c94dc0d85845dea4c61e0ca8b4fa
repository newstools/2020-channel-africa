In the Western Cape, the Education Department has urged communities to support the learners’ return. President Cyril Ramaphosa last month announced that public schools would take a four-week break as the coronavirus pandemic approached its peak. However, matrics and grade seven learners had shorter breaks of one week and two weeks respectively. The provincial department spokesperson Bronagh Hammond says it’s been a tough year, but the matriculants still need to get ready for the final exams. She says the on and off school year has also taken its toll on educators. “The Grade 12 educators have a lot of pressure on them at the moment because of the time that has been lost, but I know many have been working very, very hard to ensure that they keep up with the curriculum.  And now a lot of it is about revision and we hope that we can just get these Grade 12’s over this last hurdle and we support and back every single one of them all the way.” Revised school plan The Department of Basic Education on Saturday published a revised School Calendar which shows that schooling will end by December 15, 2020.
