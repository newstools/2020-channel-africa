In a news release, the company said it anticipated about 1 900 workers will be affected by the workforce reduction through "voluntary and involuntary programs." "The company recognizes these decisions will impact employees and their families and has put these programs in place only after comprehensive evaluation and thoughtful deliberation," said the release. Earlier this month, the company announced reductions of 1 600 jobs across its European affiliates. As of 2019, the Texas-based company employed about 74 900 workers. --Xinhua--
