Daniel Pondei, the acting Managing Director of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), slumped forward in his chair less than an hour into his session in front of a committee in the House of Representatives. Following his collapse, several officials in the room went to his aid, one trying to prevent him from possibly chocking, others were fanning him while another poured water over his head. He regained consciousness was seen talking with some of the ‘rescuers.’ The committee eventually hurriedly dismissed him as some members were heard asking that an ambulance be called in. He was helped out of the auditorium with the aid of a police officer and two other men. The NDDC has been the subject of massive mismanagement reports in recent weeks. The management, however, insists that all expenditure were justified including a sizeable sum for COVID-19. President Muhamadu Buhari last week commented on the reports stressing that his government will do all it takes to uproot saboteurs of development in the region. --AfricaNews--
