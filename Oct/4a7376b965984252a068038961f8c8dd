In an address to SADC citizens and the world at large ahead of the regional bloc’s second Anti-Sanctions Day on October 25, Tax said the region was being weighed down by the economic embargoes placed on Zimbabwe by the West as punishment for the land reform programme. The sanctions have caused suffering among Zimbabweans and continue to have far reaching effects on Zimbabwe and the entire SADC region. The Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Act (ZIDERA), as was passed by the United States Congress in 2001 and in subsequent amendments, is particularly harmful to the economy of Zimbabwe and welfare of Zimbabweans.” She said the diabolical Act punishes companies that would want to do business with strategic partners in Zimbabwe, leaving the country without external support for capital projects. But against all odds, the country has soldiered on, Tax said, as it continues to scale heights mostly on its own. --Herald--
