The All England Lawn Tennis Club (AELTC) is yet to officially comment on how the ongoing coronavirus outbreak may affect its scheduling. However, with the United Kingdom government coming under increasing criticism from some quarters for their handling of the outbreak, communications officer Eloise Tyson did offer an update to Ubitennis.com. "The AELTC is continuing to monitor the coronavirus situation, working closely with the government and the relevant health authorities, and we are following their advice regarding promoting good hygiene practices across our Estate," Tyson said. "While we continue to plan for The Championships at this time, we will act responsibly, in the best interests of wider society. "In the event that the government required us to cancel, our insurance policies would enable us to offer refunds to ticket holders and debenture holders." Wimbledon was established over 140 years ago and has never been cancelled during peacetime. The French Open, meanwhile, also appears to be preparing the ground for possible cancellation. "I think, as a priority, of the health of the spectators and players," tournament director Guy Forget told L'Equipe. "We will explore all the possibilities but anyway, it is not going to be up to the French federation. We will follow the recommendations (of the government)."
