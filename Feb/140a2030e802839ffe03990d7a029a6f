“The United Nations in Libya regrets that its regular flights, which transport its staff to and from Libya, are not granted permission by the LNA to land in Libya,” the UN mission in Libya (UNSMIL) said in a statement, referring to Haftar’s Libya National Army. “This practice has been repeated on several occasions in the past weeks,” it added. --Reuters-
