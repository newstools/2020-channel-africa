Police say the arrested politicians wanted to disrupt peace while protesting against the results of last week's elections. The Chadema and ACT-Wazalendo parties have called for mass action from Monday to demand fresh elections. Incumbent President, John Magufuli, was declared winner with 84% of the vote. His Chama Cha Mapenduzi (CCM) party also won an overwhelming majority in parliament. The Head of police in the commercial hub of Dar es Salaam, Lazaro Mambosasa, said Monday's planned protests were not allowed. He said some opposition figures were planning violent protests. Others arrested include former Arusha Mjini Member of Parliament, Godbless Lema and former Mayor, Boniface Jacob. --BBC--
