Mboweni says if South Africa cannot affect deep structural economic reforms, then game over for the country.

"If you stay as you are and you are going to be downgraded to Junck (sic) Status!! The consequences are dire. Your choice," Mboweni warned, without specifying who he addressed. "What are critical Economic Strategic Reforms? Read the National Treasury now Government Document! Let us move forward, many Steps at the same Time!!" In August 2019, Treasury released a discussion document - called "Economic transformation, inclusive growth, and competitiveness: towards an economic strategy for South Africa" - that recommended big economic reforms which it believed could create 1 million jobs. Its proposals included introducing more private competitors to Transnet, that metros should take control of rail, small businesses should be exempted from industry wage agreements, reducing red tape for businesses by 25% over five years and that households and businesses should be able to sell electricity that they produce. While largely welcomed by business, the policy document and Mboweni faced resistance from within the African National Congress (ANC), as well as from its labour allies, with Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) among its most vocal critics. The unions objected to proposed labour market deregulation in particular. The draft paper was adopted in part by the ANC's national executive committee in October 2019, and published as part of the medium-term budget policy statement. --News24--
