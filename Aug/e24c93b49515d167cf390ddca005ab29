In a race dictated by tyre wear and strategy, six-times world champion Hamilton swept past Mercedes team mate Valtteri Bottas two laps from the end to take second place and stay 30 points clear in the standings. Hamilton, who gained an extra point for fastest lap, also equalled Ferrari great Michael Schumacher’s record of 155 career podium finishes and extended his own unmatched scoring run to 38 races in a row. “I didn’t see it coming, but after the first stint it seemed like we were really good on tyres,” said Verstappen as he celebrated a ninth career win that lifted him to 77 points with Hamilton on 107. “I didn’t really have a lot of tyre issues at all. We just kept pushing.” An unhappy Bottas dropped to third overall on 73 points after starting on pole position in a race run, like all the others, without spectators due to the COVID-19 pandemic. “As a team, we were sleeping at some point when Max managed to get ahead of us and my strategy was far, far from ideal. Lots to learn from today, I think,” said the Finn. Mercedes had won the delayed season’s four previous races, and taken every pole, but Verstappen was alone among the top 10 on the grid to start on the hard tyres and it paid off in a race celebrating the championship’s birth at Silverstone in 1950.
