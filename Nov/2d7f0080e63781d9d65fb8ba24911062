In a sign of the sector’s growing appeal, year-to-date flows into emerging bonds have turned positive for the first time in eight months, with $3.5 billion flowing in during the week to November 18, the fourth largest inflows ever, according to BofA, citing EPFR Global data. A breakdown of the push into emerging market corporate debt is not available, but fund managers see signs of growing interest as the passing of the US election and progress on COVID-19 vaccines reawakens investors’ appetite for risk. “The Fed has indicated it will not hike rates for a long time and in this environment the search for yield will continue and intensify,” said Rodica Glavan, head of emerging market corporate fixed income at Insight Investment.

“People need to put money to work and as inflows come in they will need to be invested and EM corporates stand to benefit.” EM corporate fixed income offers a year-to-date return of 5.6%, less than 30-year Treasury bonds, but more than other fixed income peers like US corporate high-yield and emerging market sovereign, according to BofA. And investors see more upside potential as emerging market corporate bond spreads are trading at around 320 basis points, short of the 255 basis points level of mid-February, indicating there’s room for more tightening and, therefore, more returns. Their bullishness is built on a belief that a COVID-19 vaccine should help tip the balance back in favour of sectors such as trade, tourism and commodities, the engines motoring emerging markets that have been sputtering since the pandemic.
