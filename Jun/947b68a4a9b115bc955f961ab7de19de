The news was confirmed on the club's official website. "The 28-year-old is disciplined in the tough art of front-row combat having scrummed his way through and up the various age-group ranks in South Africa culminating in Junior Springbok selection for the World Rugby U20 Championship in 2011," read a statement. "Schoeman is a reliable and skilful front-row operator and will add further dominance to Bath’s already formidable front five." Schoeman is a former Junior Springbok and he represented the Blue Bulls before making the move to join the Sharks in 2015. --Sport24--
