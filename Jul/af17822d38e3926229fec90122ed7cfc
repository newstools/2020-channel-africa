The bloc will contract a record 8.7% in 2020 before growing 6.1% in 2021. It compares with the EC's May 2020 forecast of a 7.7% slump and 6.3% growth. France, Italy and Spain will struggle the most, the EC said. Its revised forecast comes amid concerns about the United States economy after a surge in infections. This has prompted several states to delay or reverse lifting restrictions. Commission Valdis Dombrovskis said in a statement: "The economic impact of the lockdown is more severe than we initially expected. "We continue to navigate in stormy waters and face many risks, including another major wave of infections." The Commission revised its previous forecasts because lifting coronavirus lockdown measures in Eurozone countries was taking longer than it had initially thought. --BBC--
