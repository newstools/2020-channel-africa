Morena, is often used in a variety of positions by Masandawana mentor, Pitso Mosimane, whether it is at right-back, winger or even up front. A characteristic of Morena's is his lightning quick speed and high stamina levels meaning he is able to cover every blade of the grass for the Brazilians. And the 26-year-old says it doesn't matter if he plays at right-back as he is still able to influence the game in an attacking manner from that position, which is what he likes doing. "Even though I play at right-back, when I look at my game I just don't look for the right-back possibilities. I always look for the gaps in the attacking areas and I think that gave my coaches confidence to put me in those attacking positions," Morena told KickOff. "I also look at what right wingers do, what the strikers do and what I can do if I'm played there. It's more about making sure that the team benefits from whatever position I'm placed at in a particular match. It also depends on the tactics of the day and the opposition because I actually sit down and watch videos with the coaches before we decide what my role will be in a particular game.‚Äù he added. "What I'm happy about is the fact that I've been able to adapt and keep my game at a good level in whatever position I've been asked to play. I also look around me and not at one position." --News24--
