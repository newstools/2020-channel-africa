This comes following intense pressure on Fakhfakh from members of parliament the past week over a brewing alleged financial scandal. He lasted less than six months as Prime Minister, making this the shortest time in office for a Tunisian government. Fakhfakh’s resignation also came after rifts in parliament, led by the moderate Islamist party Ennahda, and threats by lawmakers to withdraw confidence in his government over alleged conflict of interest. He is accused of maintaining shares in private companies that won state contracts amounting to $15m. The outgoing prime minister has denied accusations of corruption and has previously said he would step down if an ongoing investigation showed any wrongdoing. A statement from the Prime Minister’s office described the resignation as serving the national interests of the country and one that offers the president a new way out of the crisis. The president is expected to appoint Fakhfakh’s successor within a week’s time - who will have a maximum of two months to form a government that wins the confidence of lawmakers. --BBC--
