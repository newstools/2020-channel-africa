Results are expected in the coming days. A smooth handover would be a rare bright spot for a country that has seen four coups since gaining independence from France in 1960, and is blighted by poverty and Islamist violence that has killed hundred of civilians and soldiers in the in 2019 alone. It would also contrast with Ivory Coast and Guinea, whose presidents this year used constitutional changes to extend their tenures to three terms, raising fears of a democratic backslide in West Africa. “It’s extremely important for us because we are seen as the champion of the coup d’etat,” said 50-year-old Massaoudou Abdou who voted in a school in the town of Maradi in southern Niger. “In 60 years of independence, this is the first time,” he said, referring to the passing of power from one elected president to another. There were no reports of widespread disruptions. Former interior minister Mohamed Bazoum, the ruling party’s candidate, is the overwhelming favourite to succeed President Mahamadou Issoufou, who is stepping down after two five-year terms leading the country of 23 million. Bazoum, 60, has promised continuity with Issoufou’s policies, while also vowing to clean up pervasive corruption.
