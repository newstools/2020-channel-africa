Evidence of the killings comes from members of the public who rang their hotline or sent in videos, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) adds. It says law enforcers have killed 18 people in Nigeria since lockdowns began in March 30. Coronavirus has killed 12 people, according to health ministry data. Nigeria, which has a population of about 200 million people, has reported 407 cases of coronavirus but there are fears it could spread quickly in overcrowded parts of the country. At least 1 476 people were killed by state actors in the country over the past year, says the Council on Foreign Relations. In its report about Nigeria's coronavirus lockdown period, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), a government agency, said it had found "8 separate incidents of extrajudicial killings leading to 18 deaths”. In total the group said it received more than 100 complaints across 24 of Nigeria’s 36 states - including Lagos, Ogun and Abuja. Those three parts of the country this week had their two-week lock down extended. Other areas have set a variety of restrictions, which have seen the police and army called out to enforce them. --BBC--
