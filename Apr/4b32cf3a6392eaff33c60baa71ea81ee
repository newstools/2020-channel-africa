The Ministry of Agriculture published dairy industry regulations that introduce stringent conditions for the importation of dairy products to stop dumping, particularly from Uganda. Recently, milk imports from Uganda have been impounded at the border. The regulations are a departure from the controversial draft published last year, which was shelved after farmers termed it punitive and draconian. In the revised regulations, milk processors in Kenya will no longer set and adjust farm gate prices at will, which they apply when there is either a shortage or a glut. The new regulations are meant to cushion dairy farmers whose fortunes have been on a decline in recent years, raising fears of a collapse of the once thriving sub-sector. The government also plans to introduce price controls to protect farmers from exploitation by processors. --TheEastAfrican--
