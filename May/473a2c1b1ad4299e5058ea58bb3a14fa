The news was confirmed on Friday morning on the club's website. Ackermann, who spent three years at Gloucester, thanked the club. "Being head coach of Gloucester Rugby has been a tremendous privilege for me, and I have loved every minute of it," he said in a statement. "Working with such a fantastic group of players and coaches has been a great experience. I would especially like to thank Martin [St Quinton] for the faith that he has shown in me. His support and friendship have meant a lot to me. "Gloucester Rugby fans are a truly unique group, and I will always cherish the memories I have of being at Kingsholm. I wish the Club nothing but the best." Gloucester chairperson Martin St Quinton wished Ackermann well. "I’d like to put on record our thanks to Johan for the significant contribution he’s made to the club over the three seasons he’s been with us," he said. "His infectious enthusiasm for the game, as well as his in-depth rugby knowledge, made him not only a fans’ favourite, but a strong leader of our playing department. I wish him every success in his new venture." --NEWS24--
