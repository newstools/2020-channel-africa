â€œIt is alarming to learn that several people have been killed and injured during the on-going protests against the Special Anti-Robbery Squad in Nigeria. It is crucial that those responsible of abuses be brought to justice and held accountable. This adds another voice to increasing condemnation of the crackdown from politicians around the world. US presidential candidate Joe Biden said his "heart goes out to all those who have lost a loved one in the violence". In a tweet, Former US Secretary of State Hilary Clinton asked Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari and the Nigerian army to "stop killing young #EndSARS protesters". The issue has also been brought up in the UK's House of Commons by Labour MP Stephen Doughty who asked if the government will be urgently speaking with the Nigerian High Commissioner. --BBC--
