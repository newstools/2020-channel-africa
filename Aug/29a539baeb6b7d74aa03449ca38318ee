SoftBank Group’s shares were up almost 5% as a series of massive asset sales and share buybacks fuel its climb from March lows. SoftBank Corp’s shares were trading at 1,385 yen in Monday morning trade - below its December 2018 IPO price of $15, as its CEO Ken Miyauchi struggles to excite investors about the long-term growth prospects for Japan’s third-biggest carrier. SoftBank Group “is manifesting a much disciplined approach to managing its balance sheet (in a welcome change) but does not bode so well for (SoftBank Corp’s) shareholders,” Jefferies analyst Atul Goyal wrote in a note. Group CEO Masayoshi Son has already cut exposure to the telco he built despite its ample dividends as he bulks up cash reserves during the coronavirus outbreak. --Reuters--
