The Law Society of Kenya (LSK) said it will also remove the Solicitor General and Attorney General from its list of advocates for misadvising the president. This follows the President's refusal to swear in 41 judges proposed to him by a commission, with the chief justice blaming him for causing a near paralysis of court operations. "We cannot have somebody who has taken the oath to govern in tandem with the constitution who fails to perform his duties under the constitution," said LSK president Nelson Havi. Kenyatta said in February that he could not swear in the judges as some of them had integrity issues. --BBC--
