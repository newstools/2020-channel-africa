The council is made up of government, labour, business and community as social partners. Nedlac, chaired by President Cyril Ramaphosa, convened a virtual discussion on Thursday on how South Africa can come out of financial difficulties, which have been worsened by the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. In a statement, the council says the economic crisis is increasing levels of vulnerability. “Nedlac constituents agree that the economic crisis is increasing levels of vulnerability, including extreme poverty and hunger and that measures are required to stem further declines in GD; a worsening of the budget deficit and deeper job losses.” Nedlac social partners say the government must intensify the fight against corruption in order to ensure that it does not undermine economic recovery efforts. The council says it will nominate senior leadership to serve on a team that will set priority actions for economic reconstruction and institutional arrangements to support these actions.
