According to Teamtalk, the Nigeria international has been offered to Newcastle United, West Ham United, Crystal Palace, Sheffield United and Burnley. The 28-year-old is a free agent after bringing his two-year stay in Saudi Arabia to an end in late October. Musa scored 11 goals in 57 games for the Riyadh-based club but requested a termination of his contract after stating his desire to play at the top level in Europe once again. Musa starred for CSKA Moscow after joining the Russian club from VVV-Venlo in 2012 and a move to Leicester City duly followed. He failed to find his feet at the Premier League club, netting five times in 33 matches before returning to Moscow on-loan. A permanent move away from the Foxes followed after the 2018 FIFA World Cup and having spent the last two years playing in the Saudi Professional League he now yearns for European club football once again. Apart from England, Musa is also understood to have attracted interest from clubs in Spain, Italy and Russia according to the report. The Super Eagles captain started both of Nigeriaâ€™s 2022 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) qualifers versus Sierra Leone this month. --AfricaNews--
