Monetary authorities are concerned about stability of the currencies, with fears their persistent fall in value against major foreign currencies could make repayment of external loans in foreign currencies an arduous task. The resultant increase in interest payments is expected to be a substantial drain on resources which could have otherwise been used to finance development programmes. By June this year, EA economies (Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania and Rwanda) had accumulated over $86 billion worth of public debt, with Kenya holding 77.11%of the debt, followed by Uganda (17.4%), Rwanda (five per cent) and Uganda (0.4%). The increase in the EA debt is largely explained by the countries’ attempts to grow the economies through borrowed funds spent mainly on infrastructural development amid revenue shortfalls. Kenya’s public debt stands at $70.6 billion of which domestic and external debt stands at $34 billion and $36.6 billion respectively. --TheEastAfrican--
