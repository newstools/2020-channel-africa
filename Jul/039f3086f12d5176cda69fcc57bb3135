Money managers have been struggling to meet withdrawal requests from customers, cover their costs or make fresh investments. Their funds are locked up in second-tier lenders that lost their licenses after regulators last year clamped down on smaller savings and loans companies to strengthen the industry. To ease the fund managers’ liquidity problems, the government in April paid them 4.4% of the deposits they had with the collapsed institutions in cash. The balance was covered by five-year zero coupon bonds in state-owned Consolidated Bank Ghana Ltd., which was created out of some of the failed lenders. But the discounts being offered to convert the CBG securities into cash with the lender were too steep for fund managers, said sources, asking not to be identified because the talks are private. Those bonds will now be cancelled and replaced with direct government debt that will be easier to trade for cash instead of holding until maturity. The government is willing to top up with additional bonds to make up for haircuts suffered by fund managers when they convert the debt. Covering potential losses will add to Ghana’s rising debt levels. The International Monetary Fund disbursed about $1 billion in emergency funding in April to help the country deal with the fallout of the coronavirus.  --Bloomberg--
