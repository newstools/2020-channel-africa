Moyo was dismissed “with immediate effect for conduct inappropriate for a government minister”, a statement issued by the president's Chief secretary, Misheck Sibanda said. The minister has not responded to the allegations. Last month, Moyo was arrested on charges of corruption and abuse of office in connection with a coronavirus equipment procurement scandal, but was later released on bail. He has been accused of awarding three contracts for drugs, testing kit and protective equipment to a company that had failed the vetting process.
