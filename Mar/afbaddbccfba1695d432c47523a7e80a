Henry Tumukunde, a former ally of Museveni and former-security minister, was detained on Thursday. Police said in a statement he was held on charges of treason, accusing him of enlisting “the support of a neighboring country to support him in removing the current leadership”, an apparent reference to Rwanda. While appearing on NBS television on March 4 Tumukunde said: “If I was Rwanda I would wish to support people who want to cause change in Uganda.” Relations between Uganda and Rwanda have been strained for more than a year over accusations that they support each other’s dissidents. Uganda is due to hold its next presidential election early in 2020. Museveni, in power since 1986, is one of Africa’s longest-ruling leaders. Government critics and rights campaigners accuse him of using tactics including intimidation by security forces to maintain his grip on power. A committee of the ruling National Resistance Movement has already endorsed him to stand for re-election. One of his opponents will be Bobi Wine, a pop star and lawmaker whose large support base among the youth has fueled worry in the ruling party and provoked a security crackdown on his supporters.
