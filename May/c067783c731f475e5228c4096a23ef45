On Thursday and Friday, 43 prisoners tested positive for Covid-19 at the Ndolo military prison in central Kinshasa, Africa's third largest city with at least 10 million inhabitants. "Tests of all detainees are in progress," according to the latest bulletin by health authorities. The prison holds 1900-2000 prisoners, according to different sources. DRC has registered 10-20 new cases of the virus per day since it was first detected there on March 10. The nation has reported 604 cases in all, mostly in Kinshasa, and 32 deaths. Health Minister Eteni Longondo wants to isolate those infected in the prison and sanitize the cells. He said that "a woman who brought food" had introduced the virus into the prison. In mid-April, the non-governmental organisation Human Rights Watch (HRW) warned that "the Democratic Republic of Congo's overcrowded and unsanitary prisons are at grave risk of COVID-19 outbreaks." HRW, citing figures by the UN peacekeeping mission MONUSCO, said: "Congo's main prisons are at 432 % of capacity." The prison in Goma had an even higher rate of 600 %, it added. --News24--
