Market watchers await Wednesday’s budget with abated breath, hopes pinned on a modicum of clarity on the embattled parastatals and dire debt situation.

We anticipate that the budget outcome end-February will not be enough to avoid a Moody’s downgrade, which will include a heavier tax burden to further stifle private consumption growth, and hence will be the last nail in the coffin to force a downgrade action to junk status.

Moody’s decision to slash the growth outlook for 2020-21 raised red flags ahead of the rating agency’s pivotal March rating action schedule. 

At the close of local trade, the rand quoted 0.15% stronger at R15.08/$. The Rand traded weaker overnight. Expected range today R14.90/$ - R15.15/$.
