The regulator said the media house, which owns a TV station and radio stations, was banned for announcing election statistics that had not been approved by the National Electoral Commission. The ban follows a complaint by the electoral commission. The country is set to hold elections in October. The media house has been told to apologise on air before the ban starts on Friday. This comes after the regulator recently introduced strict rules that require media outlets to secure a permit before airing material produced externally, including materials from international broadcasters. --BBC--
