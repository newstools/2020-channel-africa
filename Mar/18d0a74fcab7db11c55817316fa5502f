So far a total of 3.441 of the groupâ€™s 5.062 stores are closed, which together with subdued demand in the markets that are still open, has had significant negative impact on sales so far in March, the company said in a statement. H&M said several measures were being taken in respect of buying, investments, rents and staffing, among other areas.
