Ramaphosa was speaking hours after the first case of the virus, called COVID-19, was confirmed in South Africa. “We will keep informing South Africans openly and transparently about a number of steps we will be taking because this will turn out to be a national crisis,” the President said. “It will have a huge impact on travel, and a negative impact also on our economy.” --Reuters--
