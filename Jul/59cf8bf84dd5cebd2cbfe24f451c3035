This is according to the statement from advocacy group Black Women for Wellness.  

The groups, which include educational institutions such as Emory University and activist groups such as Greenpeace, among others, also want the company to recall existing inventory in North America.         

Janette Robinson Flint, the executive director of Black Women for Wellness, said in a statement that J&J's choice to continue marketing baby powder in international markets, often to Black and Brown consumers, contradicts a statement it issued in June committing to fighting racial inequality.   

J&J said in May it would stop selling its talc Baby Powder in the United States (US) and Canada, saying demand had fallen in the wake of what it called “misinformation” about the product’s safety amid a barrage of legal challenges.   

However, J&J said it would continue to sell its talc-based products in other markets around the world.   

“Decades of independent scientific studies by medical experts around the world support the safety of Johnson’s Baby Powder,” J&J said in a statement on Wednesday. “We continue to offer this product in many other regions around the world where there is higher consumer demand.”
