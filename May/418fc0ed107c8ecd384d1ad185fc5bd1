US inflation plunged from 1.5% year on-year in March to 0.3% year on-year in April, posting the largest decline since 2008. 

This, in turn, fuelled speculation than the US might adopt negative interest rates somewhere in the future, which put the dollar on the defensive during yesterday’s session. 

At the close of local trade, the rand quoted 0.96% stronger at R18.23/$. The rand fell during New York trading but regained somewhat early this morning. Expected range today R18.20/$ - R18.60/$.
