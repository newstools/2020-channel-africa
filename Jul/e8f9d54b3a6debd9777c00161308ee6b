This came two days after National Treasury, in a briefing to Parliament, presented a slide presentation to a parliamentary committee stating that South African Airways (SAA) did not require further bailouts as it was insolvent. The presentation stated that SAA and SA Express and Alexkor should be "closed", which led some, including the opposition party Democratic Alliance (DA), to surmise it meant Treasury wanted to close the embattled airline down. This section of the presentation was not, however, discussed during the committee meeting. In a statement on Sunday, the unions said they have instructed their lawyers to "prepare a legal challenge in order to ensure that those who are intent on liquidating South African Airways will be stopped in their tracks. â€œWe want to state emphatically that National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) and Sacca will under no circumstances accept the liquidation of SAA, also South African Express, or any other State Owned Entity." In June, creditors voted in favour of postponing a vote on the airline's business rescue plan to July 14, which raised the possibility that the flag carrier could eventually be liquidated in what would be an unprecedented end for a state-owned enterprise. --News24--
