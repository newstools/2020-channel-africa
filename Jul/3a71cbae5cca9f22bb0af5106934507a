Woods will attempt to capture a record 83 career US PGA title after having matched Sam Snead's all-time mark by winning last October's Zozo Championship in Japan. "I am looking forward to playing in the @MemorialGolf next week," Woods tweeted. "I've missed going out and competing with the guys and can't wait to get back out there." Spectators will not be allowed at the tournament because of tightened Covid-19 restrictions in Ohio. The Memorial was to have been the first PGA event to allow limited numbers of fans back since the coronavirus pandemic shutdown began in March 2020. Woods has won a record five Memorial titles, lifting the trophy in 1999, 2000, 2001, 2009 and 2012. But he also fired a humbling career-worst 85 in the third round in 2015. The 44-year-old US legend played and captained the triumphant US team in last December's Presidents Cup in Australia but has made only two prior starts in 2020, sharing ninth at Torrey Pines in January and placing 68 at Riviera in February in his first chances to surpass Snead on the all-time win list. --News24--
