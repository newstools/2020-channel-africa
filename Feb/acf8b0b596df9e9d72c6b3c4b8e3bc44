Bayer said after publishing its earnings outlook for 2020 it was in no rush to reach terms with plaintiffs’ lawyers and was less inclined to set aside funds for any deal following recent United States (US) decisions in its favor. Shares in Bayer have shed a quarter of their value since mid-2018 when the company lost the first US lawsuit claiming that glyphosate-based Roundup - acquired via Bayer’s $63 billion takeover of Monsanto that year - causes cancer. “If we were to submit to the imperative of a deadline we would very likely not achieve the best outcome for our company and our shareholders,” Chief Executive Werner Baumann told a news conference when asked if a settlement before Bayer’s annual investor meeting on April 28 was on the cards. While media reports have recently raised the prospect of a settlement, Bayer Chief Financial Officer Wolfgang Nickl said recent endorsements underscored its decision not to make financial provisions for a deal beyond legal fees. In December 2019, the US Justice Department said in a so-called amicus brief that a federal appeals court should reverse a lower court verdict finding Bayer liable in a Californian Roundup case. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also reaffirmed this year that glyphosate was safe.
