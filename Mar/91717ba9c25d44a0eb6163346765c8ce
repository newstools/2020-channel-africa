The virus has brought a halt to world sport and SAFA has since advised all members to suspend all football matches and events attended by more than 100 people. On Monday, the Premier Soccer League held an "urgent meeting" with its executive committee following President Cyril Ramaphosa's address to the nation on Sunday evening.

After that meeting, PSL chairperson Irvin Khoza announced that all matches in the Absa Premiership, GladAfrica Championship and the Multichoice Diski Challenge have been suspended.
