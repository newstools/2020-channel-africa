The two leaders met in Egypt's capital, Cairo, on Sunday as President Kenyatta returned home from France. A brief from Egypt's Spokesperson said: “The meeting touched on the latest regional developments of mutual interest, especially with regard to the issue of the Renaissance Dam, as it was agreed to intensify co-ordination between the two countries during the coming period on this sensitive and vital issue". Kenya did not mention the dam issue and only said that the two leaders discussed subjects of mutual interest "among them regional peace and security, trade and Africa's response to Covid-19". Ethiopia's renaissance dam on the River Nile expected to provide power to up to 65 million Ethiopians. Egypt almost totally relies on the River Nile for its water supply and recently warned the dam was "a threat of potentially existential proportions". Kenya is an observer in an African Union-led mediation process to resolve the stand-off. --BBC—
