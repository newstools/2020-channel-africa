The charge sheet states that he committed the offence against a 15-year old girl in October in the western Nandi county. He denied the charge and was released on a bail of 200 000 Kenyan shillings ($1 830), according to local media. A crowd of protesters carrying placards had gathered outside the court's premises from early morning, the Daily Nation website reports. --BBC--
