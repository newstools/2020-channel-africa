Verstappen, who has committed his long-term future to Red Bull until 2023, recorded his best-ever finish of his Formula 1 career to date with a P3 finish behind World Champion Lewis Hamilton and second-placed Valtteri Bottas, winning three races in the process. Red Bull's partnership with engine supplier Honda delivered some encouraging signs in their first season together and Verstappen feels there is "no question" that the two parties are heading in the right direction. When asked if the groundwork had been put in for a potential title challenge in 2020, Verstappen told Motorsport.com: "I think so. I think we are in the right direction. There's no question about that. Now, it's just about how much development we can push through for next year. I more or less know, I just hope it's going to be enough. "Next season, there are no real changes in the regulations anyway, so you can just build on what you have now. And with a second year working with Honda, I think that should help. "We massively improved the performance of the engine. I think we know where we have to improve on, we've already improved on the car. We know that we have to be there from the start if you want to fight for the championship."
