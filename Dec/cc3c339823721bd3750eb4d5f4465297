Imam Oumarou Diarra, a close ally to the influential Imam Mahmoud Dicko, submitted his resignation on Tuesday in a letter to President Bah Ndaw. In the letter, he said the council does not meet his expectations. His appointment to the council had sparked controversy in his June 5 Movement, which had boycotted the body. The BBC's Lalla Sy says the resignation highlights the lack of consultations in the choice of council members, some of whom had shown no willingness to be part of it. --BBC--
