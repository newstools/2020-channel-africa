Human Rights Defender's Coalition (HRDC) said its chairperson, Timothy Mtambo, who was being sought by police, will be escorted by well-wishers to a station in the capital, Lilongwe. Police Publicist, James Kadadzera, stated that an arrest warrant had been issued for Mtambo. Two other HRDC members were arrested on Sunday and charged with inciting violence. The group had announced plans to shut down the presidential residences across the countries to protest against President Peter Mutharika's decision not to sack the head of the electoral commission, Jane Ansah. She has insisted there there was no wrongdoing in last year's presidential poll. But the Constitutional Court annulled the results after finding serious irregularities, including the use of correction fluid on tally sheets. HRDC has been calling for changes in the commission before a rerun of the presidential election that was nullified in February.
