The epidemic may be over by April, said the Chinese government’s top medical adviser on the outbreak. Brent crude LCOc1 settled at $54.01 a barrel, up 74 cents, or 1.4%, having dropped on Monday to its lowest since January 2019 at $53.11. 

United States (US) West Texas Intermediate CLc1 crude settled at $49.94 a barrel, up 37 cents, or 0.8%. “The market is trying to bottom, to be optimistic and look beyond the virus,” said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. Investors remain wary that China’s oil demand could take a further hit if the coronavirus cannot be contained and if the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, known as OPEC+, fail to agree on further steps to support prices. “The lack of any coordinated action by OPEC+ means that oversupply concerns are likely to retain the upper hand,” said Commerzbank analyst Eugen Weinberg.
