The country, whose economy is largely agro-based has been importing significant quantities of fertiliser for many years as local companies struggled to meet demand largely due to foreign currency shortages. While Zimbabwe spent nearly $662 million on fertiliser imports in the past seven years, with the government, which supports farmers though state assisted farming programmes, being the largest procurer, local companies have not benefited much. Had the local industry been adequately supported, the country would have spent $400 million, which is less $262 million, according to the Five Year Fertiliser Import Substitution Roadmap document. Observers say government investment, through command agriculture and presidential inputs schemes, will continue naturally to benefit the local agriculture value chains, together with local companies instead of foreign firms. Zimbabwe’s demand for fertiliser in a normal farming season stands around 600 000 tons, of which 70% goes towards Government farming programmes. “I am working on a domestication of local production strategy in fertiliser and other products including pharmaceuticals, cotton, leather, sugar and tobacco,” said Nzenza. Key in this strategy is the development of a robust value chain and beneficiation programme. --Herald--
