The fishermen were rescued by Kenya Coast Guards officers after making a distress call near Mtwapa where they were fishing when their vessel developed mechanical problems. Kenya Maritime Authority (KMA) Director-General, George Okong’o, said the group aboard FV Haina Hollo, a Tanzanian registered vessel, have been taken to Kilifi County quarantine centre and the boar pulled to the shore. “The vessel had departed Tanga for Pemba on June 2 with a cargo of 700 logs of eucalyptus when she was overcome by strong winds, got swamped and heavily listed with loss of propulsion power. The loss of propulsion power coupled with strong winds could have led the vessel to drift to Kenyan waters,” said Okong’o. He said the fishermen were weak and exhausted and a multiagency team of the Kenya Coastguards, KMA and the Kilifi County government officials attended to the crew in Mtwapa before transferring them to a quarantine facility. --TheEastAfrican--
