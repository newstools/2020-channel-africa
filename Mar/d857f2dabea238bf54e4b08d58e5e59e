Mthethwa has also come down hard on the organisers of Comrades South Africa for coming out on Tuesday, saying they will continue with plans to stage the marathon until further notice. The 95th edition of the Human Race is expected to take place in June this year. Earlier, the ultra-marathon said a final decision on a possible postponement will only be announced on April 17. Comrades Marathon Association Chairperson, Cheryl Winn, said, “We felt it would be premature for us to make any decisions at this stage, and so we have decided we will very closely monitor the situation by no later than the April 17. 

We will make a final decision as to whether or not we will postpone events. I think that’s really an operative word at this stage, we are at worst looking at a possible postponement. It’s quite a complex thing and it impacts upon other sporting events, particularly athletics and road running. It’s a bit of a complex thing but we are busy working on it.” Mthethwa met in Pretoria with leaders from the top seven sporting codes in the country, namely football, boxing, rugby, cricket, athletics, swimming, netball and macro sports body, the South African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee (Sascoc). The attendees included Sascoc Acting President Barry Hendricks, South African Football Association (SAFA) President Dr Danny Jordaan, Premier Soccer League Chairperson Dr Irvin Khoza, Boxing SA Chairperson Dr Peter Ngatane, SA Rugby President Mark Alexander and many more. The meeting also looks at the commercial impact the suspension of the federations’ programmes is going to have on the athletes and the federations themselves and how to mitigate this.
