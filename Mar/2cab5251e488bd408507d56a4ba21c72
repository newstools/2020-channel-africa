President Edgar Lungu announced on Wednesday that the government would not close borders points because it would weaken the economy. In a national address on Wednesday, Lungu suspended all international flights, except those landing and departing from the Kenneth Kaunda International Airport in the capital, Lusaka. He also ordered the closure of gyms, bars, casinos and night clubs. Restaurants will only serve takeaway food while all social gatherings have been restricted to 50 people. The new measures take effect at midnight on Thursday and will be reviewed after two weeks.
