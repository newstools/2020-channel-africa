Minister of Foreign Affairs Mamadi Touré denounced as "completely false" a video circulating online claiming to be a recording of a phone call made by President Alpha Condé conceding defeat to his rival Cellou Dalein Diallo. He dismissed another viral post claiming that diplomats were putting pressure on President Condé "to accept defeat and that he was trying to "negotiate a second round to avoid humiliation in the first round". Official results have not yet been announced, despite a declaration of victory by opposition leader Cellou Dalein Diallo on Monday. Guinea's electoral commission said it was the only body authorised to declare the results. --BBC--
