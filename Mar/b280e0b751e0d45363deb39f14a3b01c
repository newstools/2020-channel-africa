The Daily Sun also says that copyright concerns are another factor. The newspaper reports that manager Mitch Goldstein, who owns the rights to most of the group's songs, is embroiled in the power struggle, as well as PR Manager, Xolani Majozi. Shabalala's son, Sibongiseni, is reported to have edged out his brother Thami who had been left in charge by their father when he retired in 2014. The late singer's eldest son, Nkosinathi, told the Daily Sun that Thami was given leadership by their dad and that the family was confused when Sibongiseni took over. Sibongiseni is also quoted as saying their father left the group to all of his four sons to work together as it is a family business. One of the managers, Goldstein, is quoted by the newspaper as saying he produced some of the music for the group and manages them abroad. The other manager, Majozi, is quoted by the Daily Sun as saying he never "hijacked" control of the group, and added that Shabalala told him to work with all four of his sons. --BBC--
