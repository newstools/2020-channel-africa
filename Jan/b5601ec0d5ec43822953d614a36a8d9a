Jamaican sprint sensation Usain Bolt took to social media on Thursday to post a picture of his pregnant girlfriend Kasi Bennett. Bolt, 33, captioned the post: I just want to say a king or queen is about to be here. Bennett also posted pictures on her Instagram account. Bolt is the world record holder in both the 100 metres (9.58) and the 200m (19.19) - both set in Berlin in 2009. Bolt won Olympic titles in both sprint events, as well as a hat-trick of 4x100m relay golds in 2008 in Beijing, 2012 in London and 2016 in Rio de Janeiro. However, he was stripped of the 4x100m relay gold from the Beijing Games after his team-mate Nesta Carter was found guilty of a doping violation in 2017, leaving him with eight gold medals.
