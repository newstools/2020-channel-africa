Changes to legislation would give ministers extra powers to protect those needed to help in future pandemics, who might be struggling now. The new powers will cover firms such as pharmaceutical companies. Business Secretary Alok Sharma said: "The United Kingdom (UK) is open for investment, but not for exploitation." The government already has the power to scrutinise takeovers for several reasons, including national security or financial stability. It may block a takeover or seek assurances from a buyer about their plans for a company. But changes to the 2002 Enterprise Act will mean that the government can intervene if a business that is involved in a pandemic response, a personal protective equipment (PPE) manufacturer, for example, is the target of a takeover by a foreign firm. They will also expand the government's ability to scrutinise takeovers involving companies who work in artificial intelligence or encryption technology.Â 

"I think it is a significant development," Peter Harper, partner in the competition, European Union (EU) and trade team at law firm Eversheds Sutherland, told the BBC. "It gives them a greater power to intervene." "The government's track record of intervention has basically increased over time," he said. So far, the government hasn't stopped a deal based on national security grounds, he said, but they have imposed conditions on buyers. It brings the government into line with countries like France, Germany, Italy and Spain, he said, where the EU has been keeping a stricter eye on potential purchases. --BBC--
