Jung, the world number131, beat 120th-ranked Anderson 7-6 (8/6), 6-4. Anderson won the New York Open in 2018 but is on the comeback trail after a knee injury sidelined him for the second part of 2019. He reached the second round of the Australian Open and also represented South Africa in the inaugural ATP Cup at the start of the year. "I guess I like these courts. It's always nice to get a big win and gives (me) a little confidence boost, so hopefully I can build on that. I'm just really happy," Jung told the ATP Tour's official website. "Obviously Kevin is coming back, but he's been in two Grand Slam finals. Great confidence for me and hopefully this translates into 2020."Â
