Alex Saab - who is Colombian - was arrested in June when his private jet stopped to refuel on its way to Iran. US officials believe Saab holds information about how the Venezuelan President, Nicolas Maduro, his family and top aides allegedly siphoned off millions of dollars from government contracts. Saab was indicted last year by federal prosecutors in Miami over connections to an alleged bribery scheme. His lawyers say they will appeal against the extradition. --BBC--
