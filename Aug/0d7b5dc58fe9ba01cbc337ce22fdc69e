A settled looking team has been named for the fixture, with only Nareki coming in for Scott Gregory in the starting team. Nareki, a former All Blacks Sevens star, has made a real impact off the bench in the last two outings and been rewarded with the No 11 jersey. The rest of the starting team will get another opportunity to test themselves in what has been the toughest Super Rugby competition in recent years. On the bench there is a six/two split with Daniel Lienert-Brown returning along with Teariki Ben-Nicholas and Ngane Punivai. Mauger is looking for an improved performance from his team. "I didn't feel we did ourselves justice last week as we allowed the Blues to dominate us early and rack up some points," Mauger told the Highlanders' official website. "We were better in the back half, but it was too late. "Playing the Crusaders, we know we will have to be tuned in from the very start but itâ€™s another great opportunity for our guys to prove themselves against the competition leaders." Kick-off is at 05:35 (SA time). --News24--
