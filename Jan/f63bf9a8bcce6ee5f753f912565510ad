Brent crude LCOc1 was up 41 cents, or 0.6%, at $65.26 by 1116 GMT, having earlier touched $66 a barrel, the highest since January 9.

Two major oilfields in southwest Libya began shutting down on Sunday after forces loyal to Khalifa Haftar closed a pipeline, potentially cutting national output to a fraction of its normal level, the National Oil Corporation (NOC) said. The closure, which follows a blockade of major eastern oil ports, risked taking almost all the countryâ€™s oil output offline However, the earlier rise in oil prices eased after some analysts and traders said supply disruptions in Libya will be short-lived and could be offset by other producers, limiting the impact on global markets.
