Son Heung-min and Harry Kane each scored twice for Spurs while United's Anthony Martial was sent off in the 28th minute as Jose Mourinho celebrated a stunning victory on his return to the club which sacked him 22 months ago. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side had taken a second-minute lead through a Bruno Fernandes penalty but Spurs responded quickly, taking advantage of some awful United defending as Tanguy Ndombele and Son put them 2-0 ahead. United went down to 10 men after Martial was sent off following a clash with Erik Lamela at a corner and then Harry Kane made it 3-1. Son added his second shortly before the break as United conceded four goals in the first half of a league game for the first time since 1957 -- also to Spurs. Serge Aurier made it 5-1 in the 51st minute before Kane completed the rout from the penalty spot. United also lost 6-1 to Manchester City in October, 2011. --Reuters--
