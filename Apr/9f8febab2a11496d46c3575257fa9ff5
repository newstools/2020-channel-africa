The Bank said in a Johannesburg Stork Exhange(JSE) regulatory notice that there was a potential default for note holders holding the Land Bank’s JSE-listed  R20 bln($1.05 bln) DMTN 2010 Programme, and its  R30bln($1.57bln) DMTN 2017 Programme dated. “The Issuer failed to make a payment when due to a lender under the terms of a revolving credit facility. The Issuer failed to make a payment when due to a lender under the terms of a revolving credit facility. The non-payment of this amount constitutes an event of default under the Affected RCF. The amount involved constitutes Material Indebtedness,” the bank said. “The Issuer is engaged in discussions with the lender under the Affected RCF and is seeking a waiver,” the bank said, The Bank cited as the only reason for the default, that it was experiencing a liquidity shortfall and was engaging with various stakeholders to address this challenge, especially in regard to financial obligations falling due, “which may need to be deferred.” In unaudited results for the half-year to end-September, it incurred a R168.6m($8.85m) loss, and its net interest margin fell from 2.8% to 2.4% while the percent of non-performing loans, versus the total increased to 9.9% from 5.4%. Land Bank management blamed shifting in seasons that caused late harvests, fluctuations in agriculture product prices, and disease outbreaks for the increase in in-performing loans, at the time. News of the default follows credit rating’s agency Moody’s downgrading the Land Bank twice this year. On January 21 Moody’s reduced its rating to Ba1 from Baa3/P-3 and its long-term rating to Aa3.za from Aa1.za, reflecting what Moody’s described as  the bank’s “ongoing fiscal challenges.” --BUSINESS REPORT--
