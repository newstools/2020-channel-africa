The status of Abyei was supposed to have been resolved via referendum after a 2005 peace deal that preceded South Sudan’s 2011 secession from Sudan, but the vote has never been held. The area, which has oil reserves, is populated by the Ngor Dinka ethnic community and the Arab Misseriya, who usually foray from Sudan into South Sudan with their animals for grazing. Wednesday’s attack unfolded at 7 am local time, said Kuol Alor Kuol, head of the Abyei administration, when the tribesmen stormed the Dinka village of Kolom near Abyei town and set some of its dwellings ablaze. “Bodies got burned and you cannot recognize them,” Kuol said. It was not immediately clear whether all the dead died in burning homes. Kuol said another 18 villagers were injured in the assault before the tribesmen withdrew.
