Driving was impossible in some neighbourhoods whose level is one meter below that of the sea, although pumps were activated during the night to empty the streets. "We were not able to move about today. We are stuck in this neighbourhood by the water, we slept very badly because the streets and some houses are submerged," said to AFP Sidi Ould Yarg, cab driver. Mauritania has in 2020 accumulated a rainfall above average for a rainy season, or wintering, according to authorities. President Mohamed Ould Cheikh El Ghazouani visited Bassiknou and Addel Begrou (far southeast) on September 10. Both cities had been badly affected by floods that destroyed homes. "The president has set up an emergency response unit, promised to repair the protective barrier of the city of Bassiknou and the construction of a road to open up Addel Begrou," the Mauritanian news agency announced. Several West African countries are currently been affected by floods. Dozens of deaths have been recorded in Niger, Senegal and Burkina Faso.
