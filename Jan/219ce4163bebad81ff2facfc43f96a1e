In an interview with the ABC TV affiliate in Toledo, Ohio, Trump said: “We’re going to sign in January 15, a big deal with China.” Trump announced the January 15 signing date in a tweet on December 31. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for clarification of Trump’s comments. The Phase 1 deal, struck last month, is expected to reduce tariffs and boost Chinese purchases of American farm, energy and manufactured goods while addressing some disputes over intellectual property. Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, head of the country’s negotiating team in Sino-US trade talks, will sign the deal in Washington next week, China’s commerce ministry said on Thursday.
