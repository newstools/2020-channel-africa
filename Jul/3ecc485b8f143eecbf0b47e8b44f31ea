 The Football Association of Zambia (Faz) had made it mandatory for clubs to test players and staff as part of conditions for resumption of the league. Matches were to be played behind closed doors. The match between Forest Rangers and Zanaco FC was postponed on Saturday after the positive test results were revealed. But the league announced a resumption of all matches on Sunday after "a meeting with all stakeholders". Faz official Adrian Kashals said some clubs had relaxed adherence to Covid-19 guidelines. "We should never forget that the league resumption can always be halted if clubs do not adhere to the prescribed guidelines. Clubs will face stiff penalties for breaching Covid-19 guidelines, including losing points or matches being cancelled," Kashals is quoted by AFP news agency as saying. Zambia and Tanzania have restarted their football league that were halted because of coronavirus. Burundi continued with their league despite the coronavirus spreading across the globe. Several other African countries are expected to resume their leagues. --BBC--
