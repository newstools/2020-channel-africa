The British Formula 1 world champion said members of his Hamilton Commission "together will make a change". Hamilton will lead the group alongside Dr Hayaatun Sillem, the chief executive of the Royal Academy of Engineering. The 14 members include former sports minister Tracey Crouch and ex-McLaren Formula 1 boss Martin Whitmarsh. Mercedes driver Hamilton, 35, has set the commission the target of identifying the "key barriers to the recruitment and progression of black people in UK motorsport" and providing "actionable recommendations to overcome them". A statement said the composition of the commission had been chosen to "represent a wide range of expertise spanning critical areas of influence, including motorsport, engineering, schools, colleges and universities, community/youth groups, as well as major United Kingdom political parties". Other members include Professor Alice Gast, the president of Imperial College London and Chi Onwurah, the Labour MP for Newcastle-upon-Tyne and shadow minister for digital, science and technology. Hamilton is F1's first and so far only black driver. The sport's only other non-white competitor is Red Bull's Alexander Albon, a Britain-born Thai. Six-time world champion Hamilton said: "What is more concerning is that there are still very few people of colour across the sport as a whole. "In F1, our teams are much bigger than the athletes that front them, but representation is insufficient across every skill set - from the garage to the engineers in the factories and design departments.
