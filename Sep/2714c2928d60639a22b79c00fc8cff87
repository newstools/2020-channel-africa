On Thursday, Ethiopian officials welcomed 147 women and children from a flight paid for by the Saudi authorities. Earlier this year, Saudi Arabia began deporting thousands of undocumented Ethiopian migrants, who had gone there looking for work. In recent months, Ethiopia has struggled to create enough space in quarantine to welcome the people back and make sure that they are not bringing coronavirus with them. This has led some of the migrants to be held in degrading conditions in Saudi Arabia, the UK's Daily Telegraph newspaper revealed. On her arrival at the airport in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, one woman, who didn't want us to use her name, told the BBC that she spent six months in a detention camp. "It was very difficult. First, there were more than 200 of us in one room. "If someone was sick, they wouldn’t come to visit us to help. "We slept on the floors - some close to the toilet. I didn’t think I’d come home.” Another woman said: "I am truly happy that I have come back home. "I didn’t think I’d come because of all the hardships we saw there. "I spent seven months detained there. Now I praise Allah that I am back.” They had both gone to Saudi Arabia to seek work as domestic workers. All 147 will be taken into mandatory quarantine at a university campus. --bbc
