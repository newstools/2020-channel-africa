The Saturday attack in north-eastern Nigeria was the latest against the military in a region where armed groups have been waging an insurgency for over a decade. Reports indicate that the convoy was ambushed in the village of Burimari, in Borno state, while on its way to the town of Baga. The soldiers were to beef up security during the distribution of relief materials to people displaced by the insurgency but who had returned to the town. A military spokesperson told the BBC that they needed more time to get what he called "authentic" information on the reported ambush. But several sources, including a security personnel who survived the attack, told the BBC that at least six soldiers and a member of a vigilante group helping the Nigerian military in the fight against Boko Haram were killed and around a dozen others were wounded. The militants also seized two military vehicles. Meanwhile, police have confirmed that at least five worshippers were killed and 18 others kidnapped by gunmen during Friday prayers at a mosque in a remote village in Zamfara state. The state is one of several others where armed gangs frequently abduct people for ransom. A local politician in Nasarawa state has also been killed after he was abducted. --BBC--
