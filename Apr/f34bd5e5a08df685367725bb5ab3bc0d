Buying and selling alcohol has been prohibited in the landlocked kingdom of Lesotho during a 24-day nationwide lockdown due to end at midnight on Tuesday. Minister Lehlohonolo Moramotse had been expected to be formally charged on Monday by a magistrate after a video of him buying alcohol went viral a fortnight ago. He was arrested during the day and held overnight at the police headquarters in the capital Maseru. --AFP--
