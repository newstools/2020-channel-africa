``The next biggest challenge is to work with all local and international partners to preach the agreement and its benefits,'' Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok tweeted upon his arrival in Juba, the capital of South Sudan. Reaching a negotiated settlement with rebels in Sudan's far-flung provinces has been a crucial goal for the transitional government, which assumed power after a popular uprising led the military to overthrow President Omar al-Bashir in April 2019. Sudanese civilian leaders hope the deal will allow them to revive the country's battered economy by slashing military spending, which takes up much of the national budget. The official signing in Juba sealed the peace deal reached in late August between the Sudanese government and the Sudan Revolutionary Front, a coalition of several armed groups. The summit was attended by South Sudan President Salva Kiir, whose own country gained independence from Sudan in 2011 following decades of civil war. The head of Sudan's sovereign council, General Abdel-Fattah Burhan and his deputy General Mohammed Hamadan Dagalo, also attended the ceremony. Dagalo, the commander of paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, signed the agreement along with rebel leaders. The deal would grant self-rule for the southern provinces of Blue Nile, South Kordofan and West Kordofan, according to a draft obtained by The Associated Press. Rebel forces would be integrated into Sudan's armed forces. The Sudanese communist party, which is part of the protest movement that helped topple al-Bashir, also denounced the deal as a ``true threat to Sudan's integrity and future.'' The party said in a statement Thursday that the deal would ``create tensions and new disputes'' because other rebel groups and victims of the civil war did not join these talks. --AfricaNews--
