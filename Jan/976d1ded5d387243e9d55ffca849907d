Since the start of the year, as many as 1 100 migrants have left Libya by sea, according to the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), adding that a majority had been sent back to the country and detained. "At least 953 migrants, among them 136 women and 85 children, have been returned to Libyan shores in the first two weeks of 2020," Spokesperson, Safa Msehli, told reporters in Geneva. "Most were disembarked in Tripoli and all were taken to detention centres," she added. At the behest of Italy, Libya's coastguard routinely blocks migrants from reaching Europe. Rights groups charge that Libya picks up migrants in the Mediterranean and brings them back to overcrowded detention centres, where many have been victims of abuse and forced labour. The increase in departures comes after a surge in violence in Tripoli, which was temporarily tempered by a weekend halt in fighting, but with the international community so far unable to secure a long-term ceasefire. --News24--
