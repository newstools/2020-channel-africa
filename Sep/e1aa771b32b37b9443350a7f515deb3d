United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, wants to strengthen his options on the left and feels the 27-year-old would be a useful addition. Porto want Â£18 million ($23.1 million) for Telles, who has one year left on his contract and could be signed without a fee on a pre-contract in January. Telles, who has one cap for Brazil, has scored 21 goals in 127 games for Porto. --BBC--
