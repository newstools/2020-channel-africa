The inquiry will "identify mistakes" that led to the collateral damage", the spokesperson Fred Enanga said. European Union envoys have already called for a "full and independent" investigation" into police actions against protesters to "ensure justice for victims and to avoid impunity for the perpetrators who must be held accountable". Plain-clothed operatives were last week recorded by members of the public brandishing guns in the streets during demonstrations to protest the arrest of presidential candidate Robert Kyagulanyi, also known as Bobi Wine. Bobi Wine was charged with flouting coronavirus prevention restrictions and granted bail. He is now back on the campaign trail. Security Minister Gen Elly Tumwiine on Friday told the media that police and other security forces have a right to shoot and kill if protesters "reach a certain level of violence". -BBC--
