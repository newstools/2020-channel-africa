Sudan says that the flow of water downstream has declined by the equivalent of 90 million cubic metres a day. Earlier, Ethiopia confirmed that water behind the dam was rising - but did not make clear whether this was because some of its gates had been closed. The dam on the Blue Nile river is a source of regional tension: Ethiopia sees it as crucial for its economic development. But Egypt and Sudan fear it will reduce their access to water. Years of talks have still not brought consensus on how and when to fill the reservoir, and how much water it should release. --BBC--
