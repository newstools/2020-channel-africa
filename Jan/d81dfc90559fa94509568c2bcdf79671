According to French news outlet L'Epique Lyon have identified Ekambi as a possible January signing as cover for the injured Memphis Depay and Jeff Reine-Adélaïde. Although progressing to the knockout stages of the Uefa Champions League, Lyon have battled in Ligue 1 this season and ended 2019 in 12th place on the log standings. Injuries to star players and transfer rumours surrounding Moussa Dembélé hasn’t helped their cause as they aim to regroup in the new year. Ekambi started 2020 as an unused substitute for Villarreal in a 2-1 win over Real Sociedad this past weekend. The 27-year-old has scored six goals in 18 Spanish LaLiga games this season, but has found the back of the net on just one occasion in his last eight league matches for the club. Ekambi is no stranger to France’s top-flight. The Paris-born forward joined Villarreal from SCO Angers in 2018. --AllAfrica--
