The donation was in response to an appeal by the Bishop of Pemba, Luis Fernando Lisboa, for assistance to thousands of people displaced from their homes by Islamist militants violence. They have been carrying out attacks in the gas-rich province since 2017. About 430 000 people have been left homeless by the conflict. Bishop Lisboa has been heading the "Together for Cabo Delgado" campaign. He told reporters that the Pope's donation would be used to build health facilities in areas where displaced people are camping, particularly in the districts of Montepuez and Chiure. A delegation from the Episcopal Conference of Southern Africa visited Cabo Delgado last week at Bishop Lisboa’s invitation. It called for an urgent solution to the insecurity in the region and support for the displaced people.
