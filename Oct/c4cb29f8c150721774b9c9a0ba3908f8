At a two-day summit in Brussels beginning on Thursday, they called on the United Kingdom (UK) to "make the necessary moves" towards a deal. European Union (EU) Chief negotiator Michel Barnier said fresh "intensive" talks should aim to reach a deal around the end of October. But his UK counterpart said he was "disappointed" by the EU's approach. Lord David Frost tweeted the EU was expecting "all future moves" for a deal to come from the UK, which he called an "unusual approach to conducting a negotiation". He added the prime minister would react to the EU's position as the summit wraps up on Friday. Both sides are calling on each other to compromise on key issues, including fishing and limits on government subsidies to businesses. They are seeking an agreement to govern their trading relationship once the UK's post-Brexit transition period ends in December. Following the talks on Thursday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said "in some places there was movement, in other places there is still a lot of work to do." "We have asked Great Britain to continue to be willing to compromise towards an agreement. Of course, this also means that we have to make compromises," she told reporters.
