It’s a famous win and also their first against England in a major ICC tournament. At the WACA in Perth, the Proteas women bowlers restricted England to 123 for 8 in their opening group B world cup match. South Africa’s batting line-up then went about chasing down the total. Dane van Niekerk and Marizanne Kapp put on 84 for the second wicket to lay a solid base. Van Niekerk scored 46 off 51 while Kapp contributed 38 off 33 balls. Disaster struck when the pair lost their wickets four balls apart. Kapp was caught and bowled by Sarah Glenn, and van Niekerk found Tammy Beaumont at point. The big-hitting Chloe Tryon put in a cameo with 12 from 12, including a six and a four, before Du Preez, playing in her 100 T20 international, took the Proteas over the line with a massive six and a four to seal a six wicket win with 2 balls remaining, South Africa’s first T20 World Cup victory over England. Du Preez says the team wants to do something special in this T20 World Cup campaign. “It’s amazing. I’ve played in all seven World Cups and we’ve never come this close. So, for us to actually really stick up and we said we want to do something special this year and I think this is just the start of something really special. We are going to go all the way and bring the trophy home.” Next up in group B for the Proteas is Thailand on Friday in Canberra. Meanwhile, the Proteas men’s cricket team levelled the three match T20 series against Australia at 1-1, with a 12 run victory in Port Elizabeth. The series will be decided in Cape Town on Wednesday. --Reuters--
