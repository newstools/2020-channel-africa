This means they can operate as a single market with a view of reducing the cost and time of trading in shares of companies listed on markets across the borders. Uganda, Rwanda and Tanzania are set to start trading as a single market before the end of this year (2020) after interconnecting their trading systems and hooking to the EAC Capital Markets Infrastructure (CMI) Information Technology platform. Investors in the three countries will buy and sell shares of companies listed in any of the countries without going through different stockbrokers. Currently, Ugandan stockbrokers take the largest share of stock trading commission at 3.28 % of the value of the transactions, not only within East Africa but in the entire African continent. In Rwanda and Tanzania brokerage commission on equity trading are regulated at 1.5 % while in Kenya the applicable commission is limited to $1 for odd lot transactions up to $30 and 1.8 % for odd lot transactions in excess of $30. The East Africa Securities Exchange Association (EASEA) said the project that has dragged for more than five years largely due to payment dispute with the software provider and lack of integration between CMI software and the trading systems of the participating states, Uganda, Tanzania and Rwanda will remove obstacles on stock trading in regional markets, spur activities and boost liquidity in underperforming markets once operational. “We are doing the final testing on our system for the CMI project. We are ready psychologically and technically we are working on those technicalities that are remaining. On the other hand Tanzania and Uganda are technically ready,” Celestin Rwabukumba, the association’s chairman and Rwanda Stock Exchange CEO told The EastAfrican. --TheEastAfrican--
