The highly contagious respiratory virus has infected more than 42 000 people in the United States (US), prompting more governors to join states ordering Americans to stay at home. Over the past 24 hours, 85% of new cases worldwide were from Europe and the US, WHO spokesperson Margaret Harris told reporters. Of those, 40% were from the US. Asked whether the US could become the new epicenter, she said: “We are now seeing a very large acceleration in cases in the US So it does have that potential.   

We cannot say that is the case yet but it does have that potential.” “United States have a very large outbreak and an outbreak that is increasing in intensity,” Harris added. However, she identified some positive signs such as more comprehensive testing, and further efforts to isolate the sick and trace their immediate contacts exposed to the virus. She also referred to “extremely heartwarming” stories of how Americans were helping each other during the crisis. Overall, the global outbreak was accelerating very rapidly and she expected large increases in case numbers and deaths from the 334.981 cases and 14.652 deaths currently reported to WHO. WHO’s dashboard on its website, which tends to lag countries’ individual tallies, showed that Monday had by far the biggest daily rise in infections since the outbreak began in December, with more than 40 000 new cases. Harris said that new records were to be expected each day until new confinement measures begin to take effect.
