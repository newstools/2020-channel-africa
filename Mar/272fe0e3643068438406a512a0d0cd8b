This comes after well-known journalist, Zororo Makamba died from the virus on Monday afternoon.

"Right now, they don’t even have water at Wilkins. So, if you come here to be treated for coronavirus there is absolutely no treatment you will get, you will die," his brother Tawanda Makamba said in a statement which was published in the Daily News on Tuesday. The 30-year-old was the son of prominent Zimbabwean businessman, James Makamba. According to his brother, the journalist was in New York for 20 days and had a slight flu when he returned to Zimbabwe. Makamba admitted to hospital on Friday last week after he developed a fever. The 30-year-old’s compromised immune system resulted in doctors deciding to admit him. "This is because Zororo had a tumour removed from just under his left lung in November 2019, and he was under an 18-month recovery time-frame," his elder brother Tawanda Makamba said. After receiving advice to go to a hospital in Harare, Kapamba tested for the coronavirus and was told he would receive his results in six hours. It was later confirmed that he had tested positive for the virus and that he would need to return to the hospital. Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa has since announced the closure of the country's borders - except for returning citizens and cargo - effective immediately.
