The allegations come after incidents of people being given fake bank notes when withdrawing money from their accounts at banks in Blantyre and Lilongwe. A victim who spoke to Malawi24 claimed that he withdrew money from a branch of one of the largest banks in the country and when he went to send the money at mobile money agentâ€™s shop, it was discovered that one of the notes was fake. He wondered how the bank received a fake note without noticing it and then later gave it to its customers. The victim also suspected that this may be part of a scam in which bank tellers are involved. Several cases of fake money have been recorded in the country recently, including one case earlier this month where a man in Kasungu was found with fake $2 notes amounting to $420. --Malawi24--
