The plea followed reports of Prime Minister Boris Johnson receiving a damning security agency reassessment about the long-term safety of Huawei.   

The British review was triggered by US sanctions in February that blocked Huawei's access to US chips and semi-conductors at the heart of 5G networks.   

Johnson's government allowed Huawei to roll out up to 35% of Britain's 5G network under the condition that it stays out of "core" elements dealing with personal data.     

But the new sanctions raised the possibility of Huawei having to switch from trusted US suppliers to alternatives whose safety could not be guaranteed by UK security agencies.   

Huawei Vice-President Victor Zhang said the long-term impact of the US sanctions will take months to fully understand.    

Zhang said any decision to simply cut Huawei out of the speedy new network's development could delay nationwide 5G access for up to 18 months.
