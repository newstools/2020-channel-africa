Opposition parties have called for civil disobedience to protest against an attempt by the incumbent, Alassane Ouattara, to seek a third term. They say the bid is illegal. Thousands of people rallied against the move in the commercial capital, Abidjan, on Saturday.Â 

There are four candidates in all. Key opposition figures, including a former president and a former Prime Minister, have been disqualified. Ouattara became President 10 years ago in a disputed election that was marred by violence. --BBC--
