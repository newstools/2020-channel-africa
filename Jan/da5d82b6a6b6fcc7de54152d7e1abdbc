Occidental Petroleum Corp’s $38 billion acquisition of Permian rival Anadarko countered a pullback in corporate deal-making the sector, driven by investor pressure to prioritize shareholder returns over growth, Enverus said. Occidental last year won a takeover battle for Anadarko, topping Chevron Corp’s $33 billion offer, after Berkshire Hathaway Inc’s Warren Buffett and France’s Total SA came to its aid. Without that acquisition, the total value of deals in 2019 would have been $39.1 billion, well below the $85 billion recorded in 2018, according to Enverus. The data provider valued the Anadarko deal at $57 billion, including debt taken on by the acquirer. “Investors who funded the shale revolution over the last decade have become vocal in advocating for payouts and cut back on providing new capital. That flowed through to limited M&A and a negative reaction to deals for much of the year,” said Andrew Dittmar, senior M&A analyst at Enverus. However, the total M&A spend in 2019 was the highest since 2014, when oil prices peaked at $112 per barrel before beginning a slump that saw prices drop by half of that.
