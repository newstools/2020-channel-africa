Machipisa (54) was arrested on Wednesday. He is facing two counts of criminal abuse of office when he appeared before Harare regional magistrate Ngoni Nduna. The State, led by Constance Ngombengombe, opposed bail, saying Machipisa was a flight risk and was likely to interfere with witnesses. Ngombengombe called investigating officer Superintendent Moreblessing Gandinyaru to back her two grounds for opposing bail. The bail application hearing continued today. The court heard that in 2018 between June 19 and 22, Machipisa allocated fictitious stands in Mabelreign with an unknown layout plan to prospective home-seekers who were not on the City of Harare waiting list. It is alleged that Machipisa, as the acting director of Housing and Community Services, deliberately took advantage of the absence of the director who was attending a week-long workshop to fast-track the allocation process so it could be done in that single week. Upon the return of the director of Housing and Community Services from the workshop in Kadoma, Machipisa did not report the allocation, the court heard, and this was with the intent to conceal this development from him. --Herald--
