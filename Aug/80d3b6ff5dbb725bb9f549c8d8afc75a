Israel’s decision to suspend its planned annexation of areas of the occupied West Bank under the historic agreement is a “positive step”, Le Drian said in a statement, adding that the suspension “must become a definitive measure.” The accord paved the way for a resumption of talks between Israelis and Palestinians with the aim to establish two states, he said, calling it “the only option” to achieve peace in the region. --Reuters--
