In a televised address to the nation, President Paul Kagame said he sympathised with survivors who had to commemorate the event behind closed doors. Rwandaâ€™s national remembrance of the victims of the 1994 genocide usually happens at mass gatherings, primarily in the capital, Kigali, but also in villages and towns across the country. Instead, a small event attended by President Kagame and his wife was held at the Kigali Genocide Memorial and aired live on television. Rwandans are in the third week of a lockdown and are only allowed to leave their homes for essential services. Officials there have announced 105 cases of coronavirus. --BBC--
