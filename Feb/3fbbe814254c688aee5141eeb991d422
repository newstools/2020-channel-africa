Some brutal shot-making from Quinton de Kock and Temba Bavuma at the top of the order ensured the Proteas posted a respectable 177. It looked as if England were cruising to victory thanks to Jason Roy (70 off 37 balls) and captain Eoin Morgan (52 off 25 balls) as the visitors needed just seven runs off six balls. But Lungi Ngidi produced a stunning final over, conceding just five runs as the Proteas sneaked home by a single run. De Kock praised his bowling unit for sticking to the basics. "It was very tight, but we knew halfway through the stage where we were as a bowling unit. We just made sure that if we kept to our basics and understood what to get done, that we could end up winning this anyway.Â 

"We understood also as team that here in East London the wicket starts getting tough to bat on in the last five overs, so we just held on and great to see that the boys fought back so well," De Kock told SACricketMag. The 27-year-old wicketkeeper, captaining the side for the first time in a T20I series, insists he remained calm throughout despite the nail-biting finish.
