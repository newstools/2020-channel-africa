However, the soccer boss stressed that a proposed return date is yet to be agreed on. Khoza confirmed that an initially selected date of July 18 would be discussed with the South African Football Association (SAFA) to reach an agreement. All football-related activities ground to a halt on March 16, with no live action for nearly four months, in reaction to the impending threat of the Covid-19 pandemic. Gauteng will now likely play host to all 32 PSL clubs, consisting of the 16 top-flight Absa Premiership teams and 16 GladAfrica Championship teams. Likely training venues selected by the PSL are: Marks Park, Wanderers, St Stithians, Fourways High, Johannesburg Stadium, Ruimsig Stadium, Auckland Park Bunting (UJ), Chris Hani Stadium (UJ), Loftus Versveld, the University of Pretoria, Pilditch Stadium, TUT Stadium, Germiston Stadium and Vosloorus Stadium. Competitive matches will take place at the following venues when confirmed: FNB Stadium, Orlando Stadium, Dobsonville Stadium, Rand Stadium, Makhulong Stadium, Ellis Park, Bidvest Stadium, Loftus Versveld, Lucas Moripe Stadium, University of Pretoria and Tsakane Stadium. SAFA Acting Chief Executive Officer, Tebogo Motlanthe, previously strongly criticised the PSL for announcing their intention to resume the league this weekend, explaining that August was more realistic. Motlanthe said returning to action too soon would not give teams or match officials adequate preparation time. He added that it's unlikely the league will resume before August. PSL teams were given the go-ahead to resume training on June 24 ahead of a return to competitive action. --News24--
