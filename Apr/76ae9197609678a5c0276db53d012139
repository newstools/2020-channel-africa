Labour Expert from Mabhala Consulting, Bukani Mngoma, says people may lose jobs after the COVID-19 disaster as employers may want to re-organise operations. He says the 21-day lockdown is giving employers lessons on who is essential and part of the team and who is not. In some companies essential services workers have kept companies going while the rest of the staff are at home during the 21-day national lockdown. Mngoma says COVID-19 has many lessons for both employers and employees in South Africa. "You may find that employers may readjust the need to actually work from work and instead, they may say let them continue to work from home. So, there is a possibility that for some employers this has presented them with a real life study in terms of whether they really need the numbers of employees that they currently have and which may have an implication for retrenchment should they find that they have been working with staff which is in excess of what is needed."
