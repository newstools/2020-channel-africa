Juergen Klopp's side were outplayed by Scott Parker's adventurous team before halftime at Craven Cottage and trailed to Bobby Decordova-Reid's superb 25th-minute effort. They were more like themselves after the break and levelled in the 79th when Salah beat Alphonse Areola from the spot after a rather harsh handball decision. The visitors looked likely to go and grab the winner but Fulham held out for a well-deserved point to leave Liverpool level on 25 points with leaders Tottenham Hotspur. Fulham are fourth from bottom with eight points. --Reuters--
