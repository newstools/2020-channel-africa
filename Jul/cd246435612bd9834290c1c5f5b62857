Speaking to a Swedish newspaper, Martin Strombergsson regretted remarks made to Keita in a top-flight match last year. Last month, Keita said that the referee told him "to shut up and go back into his goal so bananas could be thrown at him". "I need to find a new employer in the future," said the 43-year-old official. This was the Fifa referee's response to the fact that he has been suspended for the rest of the season, which is only six weeks old. He is yet to officially hear whether his career as a referee is over but his suspension lasts until the end of his current contract. Stromgbergsson's punishment was announced on Friday by the referee's committee of the Swedish Football Federation. "Martin Strombergsson insists that he had no racist intentions with what he said," noted Peter Ekstrom, chairperson of the committee. "We have no reason to doubt this, but still consider it to be a very inappropriate statement, and it must be obvious that it can be perceived as offensive." --BBC--
