Rugby Australia on Monday proposed a Super 8 series with teams from New Zealand, South Africa, Japan and Argentina to be played at the conclusion of either a domestic or trans-Tasman tournament. The plan was unveiled as part of its drive to secure a lucrative new broadcast deal, with the current one running out at the end of 2020. Its vision includes options for either a domestic Super Rugby competition, as is being played currently due to the coronavirus pandemic, or a trans-Tasman one from 2021. New Zealand last month suggested a new event with its five existing teams, two to four from Australia and one from the Pacific in a shake-up of the struggling flagship southern hemisphere Super Rugby tournament. But there was little consultation and the plan angered its Sanzaar partners, with Australia insisting all of its teams, Brumbies, Reds, Waratahs, Rebels and Western Force, must play. Rugby Australia's pitch includes a four-week Super 8 tournament featuring the top two teams from Australian, New Zealand and South African Super Rugby, and the leading one from Japan's Top League and South America's domestic tournament. "We will do whatever is in the best interests of Australian rugby and we've been working hard on a variety of competition models, not just for Super Rugby but for every level of the game," said interim Rugby Australia chief Rob Clarke. --News24--
