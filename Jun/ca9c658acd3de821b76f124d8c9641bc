The 30-year-old made birdies on six of the last eight holes to shoot a bogey-free round of 9-under 62 to grab the early clubhouse lead in South Carolina on Sunday. Frittelli finished the tournament tied for eighth at 17-under - five shots adrift from eventual winner, Webb Simpson. "I was just trying to stay out there and keep playing and get all the good golf out of me, squeeze it out at the end," Frittelli told the PGA Tour. "That was just a nice, consistent round. I struck the ball like I did the first round and luckily I converted some putts. I'm happy with my play and that's all that matters." Following his tied for eighth result, Frittelli moved up 11 places - from 116 to 105 - in the official world golf rankings. Earlier this month, he told Sport24 that his main goal for 2020 was to "play as much as I can and hopefully make the Tour Championship". Only the Top 30 golfers in the FedEx Cup rankings will play in the PGA Tour finale. Following this weekend's performance, Frittelli moved up to 48 in FedEx Cup rankings. Frittelli claimed his maiden PGA Tour title last year after winning the John Deere Classic. The PGA Tour confirmed that 2020 John Deere Classic is cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic. --News24--
