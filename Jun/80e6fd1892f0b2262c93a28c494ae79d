President Mohamed Abdullahi "Farmajo" Mohamed of Somalia and Somaliland’s leader Muse Bihi Abdi are meeting in neighbouring Djibouti. The main point of contention is Somaliland’s political status following its decision to declare independence in 1991. This was rejected by the government in Mogadishu and Somaliland has not been internationally recognised. Djibouti's President Ismail Omar Guelleh and the Ethiopian Prime Minister and Nobel Peace Prize winner Abiy Ahmed are playing a mediation role at the meeting. Guelleh tweeted that the talks were a "perfect illustration" of regional efforts to resolve differences through dialogue. In recent years rival Gulf states have taken sides, which has raised tensions. Abiy was awarded to the Nobel prize last year for making peace in 2018 with Ethiopia's bitter foe Eritrea - ending a 20-year military stalemate following their 1998-2000 border war. --BBC--
