The Portuguese forward, 21, took Hakan Calhanoglu's pass in his stride to stroke the unbeaten league leaders ahead virtually from the kick-off. Leao's goal beat the record of 8.9 seconds set by Piacenza's Paolo Poggi against Fiorentina on December 2, 2001. The win keeps Milan a point clear of rivals Inter, who beat Spezia 2-1. Belgium midfielder Alexis Saelemaekers scored Milan's second midway through the first half before Domenico Berardi pulled one back late on for sixth-placed Sassuolo. But it was Leao's early strike that will adorn the record books, with a shocked Sassuolo defence punished for backing off as Milan surged forward right from the referee's whistle. The goal was even quicker than the fastest strike in Premier League history, Shane Long's effort for Southampton after 7.69 seconds against Watford on April 23, 2019. --BBC--
