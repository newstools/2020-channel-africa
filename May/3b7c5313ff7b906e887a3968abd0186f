On Monday, roads in Kigali were busy again, in a city considered to be a hotspot for infections. People are adhering to mandatory mask wearing and social distancing. Many are happy that normal life has resumed but there is discontent that fares in public transport have been hiked after buses were ordered to carry half of their capacity to ensure social distancing. Bars, sports facilities, schools and churches remain closed. Rwanda has so far recorded 259 coronavirus cases and no fatalities. --BBC--
