The Corona-Datenspende (Corona Data Donation) app gathers vital signs from volunteers wearing smartwatches or fitness trackers,including pulse, temperature and sleep, to analyse whether they are symptomatic of the flu-like illness. Results will be represented in an interactive online map that would make it possible - together with other data inputs - for the health authorities and the general public to assess the prevalence of infections down to postcode level. "If the sample is big enough to capture enough symptomatic patients, that would help us to draw conclusions on how infections are spreading and whether containment measures are working," said Lothar Wieler, head of the Robert Koch Institute that is coordinating Germany's coronavirus response. Germany has the fourth highest Covid-19 caseload behind the United States, Spain and Italy at nearly 100 000 but has kept fatalities down to a relatively low 1 600 thanks to early and extensive testing. The German authorities have been more cautious than some Asian countries in using digital technology to fight the coronavirus, restrained by Europe's strict data privacy laws and mindful of public scepticism towards any surveillance reminiscent of Nazi- or communist-era rule. But a similar approach has been used here to model the spread of influenza while, in the United States, connected 'smart' thermometers distributed by Kinsa Health have offered early insights into how quickly COVID-19 is spreading, the New York Times reported last month. The Corona Data Donation app, available for download in the Google Play Store and Apple App Store, is voluntary and data would be processed anonymously. To register, users should enter their postcode, age, sex, height and weight. The Corona Data Donation app was developed in four weeks in partnership with Berlin-based startup Thryve, a data-driven 'wearable health' startup which realised earlier this year that its approach could be adapted to detect COVID-19. --IOL--
