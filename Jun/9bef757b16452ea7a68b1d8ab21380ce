Together the four banks form the largest voting bloc, and collectively hold government-guaranteed claims totalling $94 million for historic debt incurred by the airline. This money has already been allocated in previous national budgets, and must be paid out regardless of what happens to SAA. SAA went into business rescue in December in 2019 following years of losses and repeated state bailouts. 

The airline's business rescue practitioners published their rescue plan earlier in the week after repeated delays. 

A vote has been scheduled for Thursday, June 25, the day after Finance Minister Tito Mboweni tables his emergency budget. "So, due to the government guarantees they hold, the banks will receive full payment. In terms of the plan the Department of Public Enterprises will retain 100% of SAA, and the concurrent creditors will forfeit billions to save a hopelessly insolvent airline with no prospects of business success going forward," a creditor, who asked to remain anonymous, told Fin24 on Thursday. Nedbank responded that, due to banker-client confidentiality, it is not able to comment at this stage. Investec also said that it is unable to comment. Standard Bank and Absa were also approached for comment, but at the time of publication had not yet responded. --News24--
