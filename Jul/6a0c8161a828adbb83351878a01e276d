The four escaped at about 19:30 local time on Wednesday and were arrested the following day. “Following information that four detainees had escaped, security organs and local leaders worked together to locate their whereabouts,” a Police Spokesperson for the Eastern Region said. He added: “On Thursday, following the release of their particulars and identities, people, who saw them, were quick to call the police.” Security and health officers are tracing people who they may have come into contact with the escapees to help stop the spread of the virus. Rwanda has recorded 1 210 coronavirus cases so far, including two deaths. --BBC--
