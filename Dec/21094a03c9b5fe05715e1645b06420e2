Mohadi was in the company of Zimbabwe’s Ambassador to Senegal James Maridadi, who also covers Guinea, Mali and The Gambia. Most businesses were closed yesterday to allow Guineans to follow the proceedings on television and other media platforms from their homes. At the main entrance to the Mohammed V Palace, security personnel demanded to see Covid-19 negative certificates from all delegates, and face masks. In his speech after taking the oath of office for the third term, President Conde pledged to listen to the concerns of Guineans and to fight corruption. He also promised to support youths and women. Critically, he wished for a “united Africa and an Africa which will be a key player in the world”. In an interview after the inauguration, Mohadi said, “I want to congratulate him for the re-election. I think it goes to show the confidence that Guinea Conakry has in him. “So our role is to congratulate him, in fact he is very close to us as we have had the President Mnangagwa visit him. Now this is the second high level visit we are having. Actually, it was the President who was invited, but because of other commitments, he couldn’t make it and sent me.” Mohadi wished Conde success. --Herald--
