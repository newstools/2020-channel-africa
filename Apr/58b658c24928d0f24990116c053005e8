Under the plan, eligible employees who want to exit the company will be offered pay and benefits package, Calhoun said in a memo. “We’re in uncharted waters. We’re taking actions based on what we know today,” Calhoun said.

“We’re also doing everything we can, that means continuing to deliver for our commercial and services customers, even as their own businesses slow to a trickle.”

Shares of the company were up about 3% in trading before the bell. Reuters reported on Wednesday that an announcement on early retirement and buyout packages could come as early as Thursday.

Boeing, which calls itself America’s largest exporter, has some 150 000 employees worldwide, nearly half of whom are clustered around marquee factories in Seattle’s Puget Sound region.

The buyout plan comes three weeks after the United States planemaker said it would freeze hiring and overtime pay except in certain critical areas to preserve cash.
