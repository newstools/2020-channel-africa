The FFP2 masks, which filter out more than 90% of particles, were ordered by German customs authorities. They and the armed forces procurement office have been helping the health ministry to get hold of urgently needed protective gear. “The authorities are trying to find out what happened,” said a defense ministry spokesperson, confirming a report first published by Spiegel Online. The shipment was due in Germany on March 20 but never arrived after disappearing at the end of last week at an airport in Kenya. It was unclear why the masks, produced by a German firm, had been in Kenya. “What exactly happened, whether this a matter of theft or a provider who isn’t serious, is being cleared up by customs,” said a government source. Kenya’s health ministry declined to comment and a Kenyan Airports Authority spokesperson said the company was still assessing the situation. Germany is preparing its hospitals and health workers for a big increase in admissions of patients with the virus. It has 27.436 confirmed coronavirus cases and 114 people have died, the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases said.
