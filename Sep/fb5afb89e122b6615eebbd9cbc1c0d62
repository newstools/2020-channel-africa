This is after Ethiopia reported its highest rate of infection last week since it confirmed its first cases in March, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO). More than 900 people have died and close to 60 000 cases have been recorded in the last seven months. Ethiopian Airlines has daily flights between Addis Ababa and South Sudan's capital, Juba, which is worrying the health authorities. "Definitely we should be concerned about the fact that cases are increasing in Ethiopia. So we need to increase our preventive measures," health ministry spokesperson, Thuou Loi Cingoth, told reporters in Juba. Dr Loi said daily flights between Juba and Addis Ababa will continue as each country is obliged to protect its citizens by putting in place safety protocols. "We will continue to receive daily flights from Addis Ababa unless it becomes mandatory, Loi added. --BBC--
