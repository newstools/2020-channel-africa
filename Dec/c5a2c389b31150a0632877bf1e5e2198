The 20-year-old left back, who also claimed the honour in 2018, enjoyed a stellar year in which Bayern won five trophies, including the Champions League. Davies earned the highest voting score from Canadian media and coaches, finishing just ahead of Christine Sinclair’s record set in 2012, Canada Soccer said. “To see what Alphonso Davies has accomplished this year is awe inspiring for the next generation of players,” national team head coach John Herdman said in a statement”. “His achievements have raised the flag in our sport higher than anyone else in our lifetime on the men’s side of the game and he has helped put this country as a football country on the world map.” Davies’s marauding runs down the left flank became a feature of Bayern’s stunning 2019-20 campaign as he cemented his place in the side and marked himself out as one of the game’s hottest prospects. Highlights from their run to the Champions League title included his dribble from the flank to tee up Joshua Kimmich to slot home in their stunning 8-2 quarter-final win over Barcelona and his run and cross for Robert Lewandowski to score against Chelsea in their last 16, first leg. --EgyptToday--
