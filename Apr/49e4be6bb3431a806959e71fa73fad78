The mudslide occurred at the border of West Pokot and Elgeyo Marakwet counties on Saturday night after a heavy downpour. A search and recovery operation is underway for more than 20 people who have been reported missing. Mud and downpours in the area have hampered the operation as roads and bridges were swept away by the floods. The government has urged people to move to higher ground to avert another disaster. At least 400 households have been affected by the disaster. The Kenya Meteorological department has issued a heavy rains advisory warning people living in areas that are flood prone to exercise caution because of torrential rains expected until the end of April.
