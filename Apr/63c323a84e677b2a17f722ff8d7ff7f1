Georgieva lauded a decision by the Group of 20  (G20)major economies and Paris Club creditors to temporarily suspend debt service payments by the poorest countries. She said the IMF’s steering committee had unanimously urged private sector creditors to join in to stem a massive outflow of capital from emerging markets and prevent unnecessary bankruptcies. G20 officials and Paris Club creditors agreed on Wednesday to suspend debt service payments for the world’s poorest countries through the end of the year, a move matched by a group of hundreds of private creditors. But finance Ministers and a growing chorus of non-profit groups are calling for broader debt relief to help other low- and middle-income countries that are also plagued by high debt burdens as they brace for worsening pandemic impacts. Coronavirus cases in Africa could shoot up from thousands now to 10 million within three to six months according to provisional modeling, a regional World Health Organization (WHO) official said on Thursday. Speaking after a meeting of the IMF’s steering committee, Georgieva told a videoconference news briefing on Thursday that the IMF and the World Bank were looking at ways to “ease the burden” on other countries saddled with high debt levels. “Of course, there are other countries that are under the burden of debt and both the World Bank and the IMF are committed to look into debt sustainability issues on a country by country basis,” she said. --Reuters--
