The announcement came as the Horn of Africa nation passed the mark of one million tests, the third highest in the continent after South Africa and Morocco. The ministry said preparations for the collaboration with China were going well. Deputy State Health Minister, Dr Dereje Duguma said Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed is advising the Chinese government on the matter and that manufacturing will begin in September. He did not give details of the production capacity but said Ethiopia will completely stop importing test kits. The country is also planning to export the product to other African nations. Manufacturing the test kits locally will help Ethiopia, Africa’s second most populous nation of over 106 million people, to boost its national Covid-19 testing capacity. There are currently 52 coronavirus testing centers in Ethiopia, with more than 20 000 test samples analysed per day. As of Sunday, Ethiopia had tested 1 018 847 people across the nation. --TheEastAfrican--
