The nine opposition leaders were found guilty on Tuesday of 12 out of 13 charges. Each will have to pay a fine of $13 000. The magistrate said he would not give them a jail sentence and instead ordered them to pay the fine. Opposition supporters flooded the court grounds ahead of the ruling. Some knelt in prayer; others chanted songs of solidarity. Police used force to disperse them, arresting some as they tried to clear the court area. In an unusual move, the magistrate for the case had an armed guard. Opposition politicians and their supporters have dismissed the charges as politically motivated, something the government denies. Critics have accused Tanzanian authorities of using court cases to harass the opposition. After Magufuli became President in 2015, he banned political rallies. He has been accused him of cracking down on other freedoms of expression during the last five years.
