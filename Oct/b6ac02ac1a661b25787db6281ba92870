University students were the first group to report back when restrictions were eased on October 1. Mozambican Ministry of Education and Human Development spokesperson, Feliciano Mahalambe, said 300 000 Grade 10 students in more than 800 schools across the country will return to schools on Monday. Mahalambe said since October 1 when Grade 12 students resumed classes, no cases of new Covid-19 had been recorded. He said the authorities will give the go-ahead for learning to resume for all students once they are satisfied that school administrators have put in place measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus. --BBC--
