He is going on trial accused of corruption and influence-peddling, for allegedly trying to bribe a magistrate in return for information about an investigation into his party finances. He will be the first former-President in modern France to appear in the dock. He led France from 2007 to 2012. There is some procedural uncertainty about this trial, however. Court hearings have been disrupted by the coronavirus crisis and a key figure in the case, former senior judge Gilbert Azibert, is 74 and will not appear in court. The France Info news website says proceedings will be adjourned on Monday because Azibert has to undergo a medical check. The trial is set to run until December 10.
