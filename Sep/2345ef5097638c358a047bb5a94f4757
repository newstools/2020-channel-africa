Alaphilippe, 28, beat a chasing group containing many of the world's in-form riders by 24 seconds. He burst into tears as he crossed the line, just as he did when he won stage two of the Tour de France remembering his father, who died in June. Great Britain's Tom Pidcock came 42nd, more than nine minutes down. Alaphilippe, who wore the yellow jersey for two days during the Tour earlier this month, broke away from the peloton with about 17km to go with typically aggressive riding. A group containing Jakob Fuglsang of Denmark, Michal Kwiatkowski of Poland, Wout van Aert from Belgium and Switzerland's Marc Hirschi followed off the peloton and sought to hunt Alaphilippe down. But the Deceuninck-Quick Step rider's supreme descending skills ensured he managed to hold an average gap of about 10 seconds between himself and the group, many of whom have won major races this season. "It was a dream of my career to win this race," said a breathless Alaphilippe. "It's hard for me to say something, but thanks to all my team-mates who believed in me today. Everybody did a great job." As Alaphilippe descended the Cima Gallisterna and neared the finish he became more and more animated, not knowing how much time he had over his rivals. The course, in the Emilia-Romagna region of northern Italy, suited his riding style and capabilities; similar as it is to races he has won before, including the one-day 'monument' Milan-San Remo last year. The venue for the Road World Championships, run by cycling's world governing body the UCI, was switched late on because original host nation Switzerland could not hold the event in Aigle-Martigny given government restrictions around the coronavirus pandemic. --BBC--
