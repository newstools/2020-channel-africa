Between January and November this year, the Nike Run Club app was downloaded 15.4 million times around the world, up 45.3% versus the same period in 2019, according to data firm Sensor Tower. 

The Nike SNKRS online store app was downloaded 59.5% times more than last year. Through its apps, Nike has information ranging from people’s height and weight to locations and browsing habits. Nike can tap into these details to craft ads and attract customers, three investors in Nike and several analysts said. Nike did not immediately respond to a request for comment about how it uses app data. At a Morgan Stanley conference in November, Nike Chief Financial Officer Matt Friend said the retailer added about 55 million new customers to its member database in 2020. The company’s practices generally seem to be in line with those of other retailers with advanced ecommerce operations, according to lawyers who advise retailers on how they can use consumer data.
