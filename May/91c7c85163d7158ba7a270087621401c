On Wednesday, the alliance partners will outline a new plan with a less lofty objective: survival. 

“There will be restructuring, there will be fixed costs reductions, there will be a number of projects which will be reduced,” a person with knowledge of the plan told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity ahead of the announcement. The three carmakers are reeling from the coronavirus pandemic which engulfed them just as they were trying to rework their partnership after the arrest in 2018 and subsequent ouster of its Chairperson and chief architect, Carlos Ghosn. Profits are plunging at all three automakers and thousands of jobs will be at risk as Renault and Nissan announce separate restructuring plans later this week. The reworked Alliance is expected to focus on more systematic divisions of labour, with one partner leading for a particular type of vehicle and geography while the others follow. --Reuters--
