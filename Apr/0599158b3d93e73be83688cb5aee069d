President Yoweri Museveni imposed a virtual lockdown on Monday to try to stem the spread of the coronavirus, which has so far infected 44 people in the East African country. He banned private cars from the roads during the 14-day period, saying that the government would assist in transporting those who find themselves in medical emergencies to hospitals. The ban on private cars was an escalation of a previous move to stop all public transport vehicles from operating. But there is no functioning public ambulance system for medical evacuations, with many pregnant women, injured accident and crime victims and others relying on private means to get rushed to hospitals. Ekwaro Obuku, a former head of Uganda’s national association of physicians, told Reuters the order to pull private cars from the roads was likely to worsen an already-high maternal mortality rate. “Other medical emergencies like maternal have not stopped because coronavirus has come,” he said. “No mother in labor pains should ask for permission to deliver her baby. We will end up having unnecessary and preventable deaths.” Some critics and rights activists have accused the government of relying on brute force to enforce anti-coronavirus measures.
