President Ibrahim Boubacar Ke√Øta had already made a similar offer, which was rejected by the opposition protest movement. The demonstrators are insisting that the president resigns, saying he has failed to address jihadist violence, corruption and Mali's economic challenges. Mediators from the West African regional bloc Ecowas have proposed half the positions in a new unity government would be for members of the current governing coalition. The rest would be shared by the opposition and civil society groups. --BBC--
