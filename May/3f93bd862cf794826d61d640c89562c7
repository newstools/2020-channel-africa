The number of so-called ‘fallen angels’ has already reached 24 this year, impacting over $300 billion in debt, S&P estimates. The 111 potential fallen angels have another $444 billion of bonds, meaning the amount is likely to spiral much further. Potential fallen angels are significant because the prospect of losing investment-grade ratings can lead investors to sell the bonds in favour of more creditworthy companies, pushing up their borrowing costs. --Reuters--
