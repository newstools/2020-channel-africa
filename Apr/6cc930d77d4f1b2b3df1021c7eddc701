On Wednesday night alone, at the start of the curfew, more than 60 people were rounded up in Kampala and nearby districts.

Another six people were opening their shops, breaking presidential orders that businesses must close.

Local media has published videos showing those arrested sitting on the ground outside the Kampala Central Police Station, raising concerns that herding the suspects together goes against social distancing advice.

A police spokesperson told the BBC that all the suspects had their temperature taken, and they have to wash their hands regularly according to COVID-19 prevention guidelines.

Uganda has confirmed 45 cases of COVID-19.
