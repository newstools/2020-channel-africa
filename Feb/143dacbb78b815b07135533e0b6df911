On a visit to Washington, President Uhuru Kenyatta said he was "very concerned" about a return to the Cold War era when Africans had to choose between the US and the Soviet Union. "Western countries, and their counterparts in Asia and the Middle East, are returned to competition over Africa, in some cases weaponising divisions, pursuing proxy actions and behaving like Africa is for the taking. "Well, I want to tell you it is not," Kenyatta said at the Atlantic Council think tank, a day before he is set to meet President Donald Trump. China has been funding billions of dollars worth of infrastructure around the world, including a modern new rail-line between Nairobi and the port of Mombasa, as part of its Belt and Road Initiative. The US has been increasingly vocal in urging developing nations to be wary, warning that they can be saddled with unpayable debts to Beijing for projects built largely with Chinese labour. Asked about the criticism of China, Kenyatta said: "We don't want to be forced to choose. We want to work with everybody, and we believe that there is opportunity for everybody. There are those areas indeed where America stands out and has much, much better strengths in certain fields. "On the other hand, you have the Chinese who build hospitals in seven days." Kenyatta said he was not only warning about US and Chinese interference but also saw foreign hands in "proxy wars" including in Kenya's neighbour Somalia. Kenyatta is expected to speak to Trump about trade policy ahead of the expiration of US import preferences in place since 2000. --News24--
