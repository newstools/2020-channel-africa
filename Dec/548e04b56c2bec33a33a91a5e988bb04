The Proteas bowled the visitors out for 180 runs to avoid having to bat again in the match. Sri Lanka began the day on 65 for two with Dinesh Chandimal and Kusal Perera well set. The pair put on another 20 runs before Wiaan Mulder made a breakthrough in the 20th over, castling Chandimal for 25. A few overs later, Mulder struck again â€“ this time removing Niroshan Dickwella for 10 runs. It was then the turn of Anrich Nortje to strike. The pace man claimed the wicket of Perera, who had shown great resistance to reach his 64. Lutho Siphamla also put his hand up, picking up the wicket of Dasun Shanaka for just 6 runs. A silly run out just before the lunch break left Sri Lanka limping on 148 for seven and the writing was on the wall. Sri Lanka came back from the lunch interval with a bit of urgency, smashing it to all parts. After taking some tap himself, Sipamla struck to remove the quick scoring Wanindu Hasaranga for 59. And on the first ball of the following over, Nortje wrapped things up with the wicket of Kasun Rajitha. Dananjaya de Silva was injured and could not come out to bat. De Silva will not be fit for the Wanderers match that begins on the third of January 2021.
