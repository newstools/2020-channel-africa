The private project, headed by French oil and gas giant Total, will explore about 150 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves in Mozambique, and is expected to deliver LNG in 2024. It has attracted funding commitments from banks, development finance institutions and export credit agencies around the world. The DBSA, a state-owned financier of large infrastructure projects, says it will finance $120 million of Mozambique’s Area 1 LNG project, which is expected to cost approximately $24 billion in total. Other funders who have committed to finance the project include Standard Bank, Rand Merchant Bank and Absa. On Friday Total announced that it had signed a $14.9 billion senior debt financing agreement for the project. The DBSA said its funding will be used for upward and downstream project development activities required to extract natural gas offshore before conversion to LNG for export. The bank said the project would present significant opportunities for South African equipment suppliers and other service providers, as well as gas export opportunities. "This investment aligns with the DBSA’s mandate which seeks to promote regional development by partnering and leveraging skills and expertise from both the private and public sectors. "Together with other similar initiatives in the Rovuma basin, the project will catalyse South Africa’s gas industrialisation aspirations and the implementation of gas to power projects," said Mpho Mokwele, head of project finance at the DBSA.  --Fin24--
