In a statement released on Tuesday, MSF said it had decided to end projects in Kimbi and Baraka in Fizi territory, due to several violent incidents against the organisation this year. MSF staff withdrew from that part of South-Kivu Province in July. “The predictability of further incidents and potential further serious harm to our staff has reached a threshold that we are no longer able to accept,” MSF Operational Manager, Ellen van der Velden, said in a statement. "The ever-increasing activity from criminal and armed groups across eastern-DRC, has led to ongoing violence and attacks against civilians at a shocking scale, including targeted killings and horrific acts of violence, including sexual violence," the statement added. Nearly 70 armed groups signed a ceasefire agreement on September 17 in the city of Murhesa to end hostilities, but decades-long efforts to pacify the region have failed to yield results. --BBC--
