The five Ethiopians and a Chinese national had all travelled from Wuhan, the Chinese city at the centre of the new virus that has killed more than 600 people. Blood samples from three of the individuals have already been sent to South Africa while samples from the rest will be sent soon, Ebba Abate, the Head of Ethiopiaâ€™s Public Health Institute said. All travellers from Wuhan are being isolated and tested, he added. Ethiopian Airlines continues to fly to China.
