The pandemic has forced Kenyan legislators to change how they transact parliamentary business. They will be meeting for the first time after a month-long recess which began two days earlier than scheduled over coronavirus fears. It will not be a full house this time after new guidelines announced by speaker Justin Muturi over the weekend indicated only 53 out of 349 MPs would be allowed into the chambers. The 53 consist of the leader of majority and minority together with their whips as well as departmental committee leaders. Lawmakers and parliamentary staff who are 58 years old and above have also been directed to follow the proceedings remotely. The MPs will consider economic interventions announced by President Uhuru Kenyatta aimed at cushioning Kenyans against the effects of coronavirus. A special sitting of both houses of parliament was cancelled last week over fears of mass infections following reports that 17 legislators had tested positive, but the speaker dismissed the claims as fake news. --BBCâ€”
