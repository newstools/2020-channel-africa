Libya's capital city Tripoli is where the United Nations-backed government is based, and it has been under siege for almost a year by forces loyal to renegade General Khalifa Haftar whose stronghold is in the east of the country. Reuters news agency reports that the camels were herded westwards out of the port shortly after midnight on Wednesday towards the city of Zawiya, about 45 km (30 miles) away, where they arrived on Thursday morning. But some camels were stolen on the way, according to Reuters. It quotes a local merchant as saying 125 of the animals were seized by an armed group as they passed through Janzour, a suburb of Tripoli. Footage of the camels leaving Tripoli en masse has been shared widely on social media.
