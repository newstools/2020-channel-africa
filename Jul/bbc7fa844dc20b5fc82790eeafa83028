Dier has been handed the sanction after he climbed into the stand following Spurs' FA Cup exit to Norwich in March 2020 to confront a fan who was arguing with his brother. An independent panel ruled it was not his sole intention to protect his brother when he entered the stands that his behaviour was "objectively threatening". Mourinho has previously said he did not expect Dier to receive any punishment and was clearly nonplussed about the decision, opting to keep quiet. He said: "No reaction. I prefer no reaction. I am not going to answer, if I answer I am going to be in trouble, and I don't want to be. So, no comment on that." On a possible appeal, he added: "I don't think so, if you appeal you have other risks. At least let's start next season without a suspension. We all know how it works at these FA decisions. "You have access if you want to the record of successful appeals and unsuccessful appeals. I don't think so; I don't think we're going to appeal." The 26-year-old accepted the misconduct charge, but denied his behaviour was threatening and argued his intention was only to protect his brother Patrick. The spectator involved told police in a statement that he was acting like "an idiot" and did not feel threatened. However, the panel chose not to believe the statement, which was not released by police and had to be communicated to the process via Dier's solicitor, instead deciding the fan was scared based on video footage. --News24--
