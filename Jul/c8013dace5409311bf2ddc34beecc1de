This latest development comes after a delegation of the South Sudan mediators returned from Khartoum on Tuesday. The peace talks, taking place in South Sudan, had stalled due to Covid-19 pandemic. The talks recently resumed via video conferencing between the government’s delegation in Khartoum and the rebel groups in Juba. Tut Galwak, South Sudan’s presidential security adviser and chief mediator for the Sudan’s peace process, who returned from Khartoum, told reporters Wednesday that some sticking points in the negotiations could not be discussed via video links. “For us to reach lasting peace; there are dossiers or issues that cannot be discussed via video link, for example security arrangements. "We have agreed that a delegation from Khartoum should come to Juba after two days from now and continue with their brothers in finalising security arrangements," Tut said. Once we complete these dossiers after two weeks, His Excellency President Salva Kiir will invite his colleagues, the Igad heads of state and the friends of Sudan who would want to witness the signing of Sudan’s peace agreement to come to Juba.” Tut said Sudanese Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok would join the discussions on Thursday via video link from Khartoum -- his first time to join the negotiations. --BBC--
