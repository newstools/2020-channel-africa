China wants to level the playing field as it opens up its financial markets to foreign players including Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley said two of the sources with knowledge of the matter. In addition to consolidation, China wants to build firms mighty enough to take on Wall Street behemoths in the domestic industry, which is worth $1.2 trillion and has over 130 firms. The merger strategy is being encouraged by the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the top securities regulator, the State-run China Securities Journal reported last month. Shenzhen-listed First Capital, with a market value of $6.2 billion, plans to issue new shares to private Capital Securities in a deal valuing the smaller firm at about $1.4 billion, said one source, speaking on condition of anonymity as the information was private. The merger of the two firms, ranked 44 and 62 respectively by operating revenue last year, could be finalised as early in 2020, the source added. Shares in First Capital surged by the maximum 10% on the news on Thursday to their highest level since August 6. --Reuters--
