The federal government, which began fighting TPLF troops on November 4, said the final phase of the conflict was over last Saturday when its soldiers seized the Tigray regional capital, Mekelle. But the TPLF's Getachew Reda said that the war was continuing on different fronts. Getting verified information from Tigray continues to be difficult as communications in most of the region are still cut. Getachew said the TPLF leadership had left Mekelle because they did not want a war in the city. --BBC--
