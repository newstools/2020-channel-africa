Due to the Caovid-19 travel restrictions and global lockdown measures, the tourism sector across the globe has been the hardest hit as players have lost potential revenue. Zimbabwe has not been spared from the effects with some operators reported to have closed down leaving thousands of people in the sector jobless. Presenting his 2020 Mid-Term Budget Review, Finance and Economic Development Minister Mthuli Ncube said, indications are that the subsector will contract by 7.4 % in 2020. On his part Ndlovu said the sector might only generate $300 million this year out of earlier projections of $1.3 billion. Speaking on Capitalk FM’s “Straight Talk” programme, Ndlovu said even the few bigger players in the economy are now struggling to meet operating costs as some have remained closed whilst others have partially opened. “Most players in the industry are small to medium, and there are very few big players in the industry who might have reserves or the financial muscle to sustain such a huge shock. He said within the country a number of small players had literally closed down. --Herald--
