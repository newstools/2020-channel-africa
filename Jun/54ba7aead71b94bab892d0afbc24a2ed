Hamilton said on Tuesday that he was "completely overcome with rage" at events following George Floyd's death. Wolff said: "Lewis is a supporter of minorities. I learned a lot from him. He asked me once: 'Have you ever had the active thought that you are white?' I said I had never thought about it. He said: 'I think about it every day.'" Hamilton, F1's first black driver, has been deeply affected by the death of 46-year-old African-American man, George Floyd, in police custody, after an officer knelt on his neck for several minutes. The incident has sparked demonstrations across the United States. Wolff said: "It is very hard for us to comprehend how difficult it is as a black man and I am happy he has come out so vocal. He is one of the ambassadors of this sport and I think it's good." Wolff said he had "seen what discrimination looked like as a young child" having spent part of his childhood living with a Jewish family after his own fell into difficulties. "Sometimes it needs events to trigger a massive wave of support for any minority," Wolff added. "It is good that Lewis, as a sports superstar, speaks out in a sport that is dominated by white males." --BBC--
