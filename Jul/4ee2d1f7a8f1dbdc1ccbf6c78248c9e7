After winning big at 2020 Cricket South AfricaÂ  (CSA) Awards over the weekend, De Kock told reporters he had an informal meeting with Boucher on his Test role. "I told him (Boucher), I don't know how I feel about being Test captain also," said De Kock. In February this year, Faf du Plessis had stepped down as Test captain, with CSA Director of Cricket, Graeme Smith, saying at the time that De Kock would not be captain in the longer format. De Kock added: "The reality is that it's too much for me to handle, being 'keeper and captain just for ODIs, I could see from a mile away that I couldn't have that (Test captaincy) on my shoulders." Earlier this year, De Kock took over as permanent T20 and ODI captain for the national side. Leading from the front, he was the best South African batsman last summer, scoring 814 runs at an average of 40.80. In his 16 innings the 27-year-old made seven half-centuries and scored his 15 ODI century against England. Despite being the star with the bat, De Kock rated his season a 6.5 out of 10. "I had too many starts and did not convert enough, which made it tough for myself," he said. "I know what I can do. I wish I could've done better, I know what I've done wrong last season and I've just got to rectify for the next season. --News24--
