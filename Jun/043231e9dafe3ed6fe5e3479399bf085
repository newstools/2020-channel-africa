The scenes came a day after NASCAR revealed that a noose had been found in Wallace's garage stall at the track, triggering a possible hate crime investigation by federal authorities. Wallace is the only black driver who races full-time in NASCAR's top Cup series and recently successfully called for the removal of the Confederate flag at the circuit's events. Monday's rescheduled race turned into a mass show of support as drivers closed ranks around Wallace. Wallace was visibly moved beforehand as his fellow drivers rallied behind him at the starting line. Multiple drivers and crew then joined forces to push Wallace's Richard Petty number 43 car to the front of the grid. Wallace exited the car and appeared to be in tears as driver after driver hugged him. Wallace, who ran out of fuel near the end of the race before finishing 14, gave a post-race interview to television without wearing a face mask. "The sport is changing," Wallace said. "Sorry I'm not wearing my mask but that deal yesterday, I wanted to show whoever it was that you're not going to take away my smile. I'm going to keep on going. "The stars didn't completely align for me today, but all in all, we won today." --News24--
