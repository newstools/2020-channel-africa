The Super Eagles and Nike produced the iconic ‘Naija’ collection which broke sales records ahead of the 2018 World Cup in Russia and it is expected that the new design will enjoy similar success based on its cultural-inspired aesthetic. The kit’s pattern was hand drawn and is highly symbolic of Nigerian heritage with nods to nobility and family,” explained Nike’s news website. “Nigeria’s crest is placed centrally on the chest with a Swoosh underneath it. The player names and numbers integrate the eagle feather into the application. “Naija” appears inside the neck of jersey and on the back of the socks in a new typeface. “The away kit is inspired by Onaism, a traditional artistic movement central to Nigerian design and craft represented in the trim details. An eagle feather aesthetic, creatively distorted, continuously repeats in ascending size to create a visual impact.” The Super Eagles will first appear in the new kit next month when they face Sierra Leone in back-to-back 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers. --AllAfrica--
