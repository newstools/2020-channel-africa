A base in Sokoura near the border with Burkina Faso was the first to be attacked, according to an army statement. The number of soldiers who died in the attack has been placed at nine by news agencies. The attackers ambushed other soldiers near the base who were responding to the attack killing three of them. A vehicle transporting civilians to Bankass was attacked leaving 12 civilians dead, according to local mayor. This is the first time the country has experienced deadly attacks since the 18 August coup. Former President Ibrahim Ke√Øta had been accused of failing to secure the country from attacks. Protesters called for his resignation for months until a military junta took over. A civilian transitional president has since been appointed and is deputised by the leader of the junta
