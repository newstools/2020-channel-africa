The gazetting of the Public Procurement and Disposal of Public Assets (Participation by Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises) Order, 2020, was disclosed by the Minister of Trade, Honourable Sosten Gwengwe, in Lilongwe. This comes after the Gwengwe in recent months led the regional consultation meetings with relevant stakeholders on the order. The order has been published in the Malawi Gazette Notice No 96, dated December 14, 2020 and prescribes preferences and reservations for micro, small and medium enterprises and marginalised groups involved in public procurement of goods, works and services in Malawi. Gwengwe said the order was necessary because the new government has noted that SMEs are facing a variety of bottlenecks to conduct business with government, which among other things, include stiff competition from big businesses. As such only a few SMEs are able to do business with government due to stiff competition from the big players that monopolized almost all sectors of the economy. He also noted that the Ministry of Trade in consultation with other institutions will immediately start a screening and registration process for SMEs. --MalawiTimes--
