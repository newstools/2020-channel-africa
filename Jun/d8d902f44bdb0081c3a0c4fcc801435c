Harmony agreed in February to buy AngloGold Ashanti’s Mponeng mine, the world’s deepest gold mine, and its Mine Waste Solutions assets for about $300 million. The deal will make Harmony South Africa’s biggest gold producer. Harmony said it issued 60 278 260 new ordinary shares at a price of R57.50 ($3.30) per share, representing around 11% of the company’s issued ordinary share capital before the placing. “We intend replicating our success in South Africa, with decades of acquiring, operating, and extending the life of mines, and extracting additional value from mining operations,” said Harmony Chief Executive Officer, Peter Steenkamp. --Reuters--
