In separate statements, the two sides also said that ousted President Ibrahim Boubacar Ke√Øta - who has been detained by the military following last week's coup - no longer wished to return to office, AFP news agency reports. West African leaders had initially demanded his reinstatement, but there has been widespread support for the coup in Mali. The mediation team - led Nigeria's former President Goodluck Jonathan - would report to regional heads of state on progress made, but the final decision on the interim administration would be made "by Malians", Col Wague was quoted by Reuters news agency as saying. --BBC--
