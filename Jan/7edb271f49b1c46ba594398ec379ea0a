In a statement, the President of WLAM, Tadala Chinkwezule, said it was "critical" that the Minister of Education "issues a directive ensuring that schools implement the court order". “We are delighted by this order, which recognises that not only the applicants, but all Rastafari children whose rights to dignity, education and religion are affected by the policy,” she added. The high court is hearing a case filed by a schoolgirl, represented by WLAM, who was denied admission to a primary school because of her dreadlocks. The court gave the interim order which will apply until a final ruling is made at the end of the case. --BBC—
