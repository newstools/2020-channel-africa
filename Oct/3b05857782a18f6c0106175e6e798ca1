South Africa, Tanzania and Malawi have contributed troops to the Force Intervention Brigade (FIB) in the DRC. At its 40th SADC Summit of Heads of State and Government, the Member States reiterated their position as submitted to Guterres, emphasising that FIB should not be tampered with and expressed gratitude to troop contributing countries for the continued support to peace and security in the eastern DRC.
