In a social media post, Modupe Odele said she was told by authorities she could now travel freely. Odele provided free legal support to protesters detained during nationwide anti-police brutality protests in October. She also set up a network of 800 volunteer lawyers to provide legal assistance to anyone detained during the demonstrations. Odele told the BBC her passport had been seized in early November as she was heading on holiday to the Maldives for her birthday. The protests which started on social media, initially called for the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (Sars) to be disbanded. The elite police unit had been accused of widespread human rights abuses. The demands of the protesters grew to include systematic reform of the Nigerian police force. During an audience with the UN Deputy Secretary-General on Monday, President Muhammadu Buhari urged the country’s young people to keep the peace, saying it was in their interest as his generation was on its “last lap”. --BBC--
