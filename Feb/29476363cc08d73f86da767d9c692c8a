Museveni had failed to appear before parliament on Tuesday following summons issued last week by Speaker Rebecca Kadaga. She sent her apology through a colleague Rosemary Seninde, who serves in the in the Ministry of State for Primary Education, and requested to appear before the lawmakers on Thursday instead. Speaker Kadaga issued fresh summons and said the first lady had one last chance. Ugandan MPs accuse the ministry of implementing a new curriculum for lower secondary education despite parliament ordering for its suspension. The lawmakers were concerned by the scarcity of textbooks and lack of training for teachers on the new curriculum.
