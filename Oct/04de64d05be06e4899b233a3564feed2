The South African President Ramaphosa was speaking in a pre-recorded address. He said Africa was continuing to call for comprehensive global stimulus to assist countries, especially less developed nations; cope with the economic effects of the pandemic. The President said the continent was encouraged by global moves to review the debt obligations of developing nations; especially those in Africa. “In our respective countries, it is only through solidarity that we will be best able to seize the opportunity presented by this pandemic to bring greater economic security to the people of Africa, to revitalise the continent’s economies and to deliver equal opportunity for all so that no one is left behind.”

Earlier Ramaphosa outlined his administration’s economic recovery plan to a joint sitting of Parliament. He said South Africa would embark on massive public works and job-creation drive in response to the coronavirus crisis. Ramaphosa said his plan could unlock more than R1 trillion in investment over the next four years and create more than 800 000 jobs.
