CBE clarified in a report that the decline in the travel receipts caused a drop in the services surplus by 31.2% to reach $9 billion in 2019/20, compared to $13 billion in prior year. The report also revealed that Egypt’s non-oil trade deficit dipped by $2 billion to record $36 billion during the fiscal year of 2019/2020, compared to $38.03 billion in the fiscal year of 2018/2019. CBE attributed this to the hike in non-oil merchandise exports by $ 1 billion to $17.9 billion, up from $ 16.9 billion, spurred largely by the rise in gold exports; and the retreat in non-oil merchandise imports by $1 billion to $53.9 billion, from $55.0 billion. Meanwhile, the oil trade balance recorded a deficit of $ 421.0 million in FY2019/20, compared with a surplus of $ 8.1 million in the prior year. According to the report, the decline was triggered by the dip in oil exports by $3.1 billion to $8.5 billion, from $11.6 billion, brought about by the decrease in exports of crude oil & oil products, and natural gas. It added that oil imports decreased by $2.6 billion to $8.9 billion, from $11.5 billion, on account of the contraction in the imports of oil products impacted by the decrease in imported quantities by 38% and the fall in world oil prices, in addition to the cessation of natural gas imports (as of 2018/2019 Q2). In contrast, crude oil imports increased.  --EgyptToday--
