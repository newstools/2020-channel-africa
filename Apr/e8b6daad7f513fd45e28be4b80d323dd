Ramjee dedicated many years of her life to find HIV prevention solutions for women. Head of actions Programme on HIV and AIDS (UNAids) Winnie Byanyima said Professor Ramjee's death was a huge loss at a time when the world needed her most. South Africa has the largest number of people living with HIV in the world. The country has begun a three-week lockdown as part of efforts to stop the spread of coronavirus. "The passing of Professor Ramjee comes as a huge blow to the entirety of the healthcare sector and the global fight against HIV/Aids," the country's Deputy President David Mabuza said in a statement. "In her, we have indeed lost a champion in the fight against the HIV epidemic, ironically at the hands of this global pandemic. In her honour, we should heed the call to flatten the curve by strengthening our responses to this global pandemic as well as continue the fight to achieve zero new HIV infections."
