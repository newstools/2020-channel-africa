The President was re-elected in this month's election whose results have been rejected by his main rival, former President John Mahama. Ghana's constitution requires the winning presidential candidate to name a transitional team within 24 hours after the electoral commission officially declares results. The team will be chaired by President Akufo-Addo's chief of staff Akosua Frema Osei-Opare. The election commission on Wednesday announced President Akufo-Addo winner of the election with 51.59% of the total votes cast, while Mahama secured 47.36%. In his victory speech the president called for unity and promised to improve living standards. --BBC--
