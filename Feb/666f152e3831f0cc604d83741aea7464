The minister, Frank Tumwebaze, said the women had made "distressed calls" to their families back home in Uganda, who in turn appealed to Tumwebaze for help. Tumwebaze said the Ugandan government was able to bring the women home with cooperation from the agency that had sent them overseas. Many Ugandan women leave the country to work as househelps in Kenya and other countries. Some are forced to work in deplorable conditions and are unable to travel home. --bbc--
