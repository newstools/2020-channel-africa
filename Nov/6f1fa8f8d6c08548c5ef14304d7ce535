Mozambique has filed provisional charges of embezzlement and money laundering against Manuel Chang who's accused of involvement in fraud, linked to $2bn of state-guaranteed debt borrowed during his term in office. Chang, who is currently detained in South Africa, also faces extradition to the US for prosecution over the fraudulent loans. He has denied wrongdoing. Three former bankers at Credit Suisse who helped arrange the loans pleaded guilty in the US earlier this year to bribery and fraud. Chang is accused of giving consent to loans of about $2bn, which were guaranteed by the government of Mozambique, to fund a fishing business, but the money vanished and the enterprise never started. The US and Mozambican authorities say some of the loans were kept secret. When details of the fraud emerged in 2016, the scandal prompted foreign donors including the International Monetary Fund to cut off support to Mozambique, plunging the country into a debt crisis. South Africa has yet to decide if it will allow Mozambique or the US to extradite Chang. --BBC--
