Six major labor unions and government reached an agreement this week with regards to the South African Airways (SAA) voluntary severance packages. Unions say the airline will start up with a thousand employees and another 1 000 will be on a training and layoff scheme. Training will take place through Sector Education and Training Authority. Government says it is pleased they have come to an agreement. Creditors will now vote to pass or reject the amended plan on July 14. --SABC--
