Wall Street’s three major indexes closed at records highs on Thursday, with the benchmark S&P 500 setting its 11th high in 14 sessions. Gold hit a three-month peak while yields on US Treasuries and Germany’s 10-year bond tumbled on optimism about the world economy after positive Chinese manufacturing data and the move to increase liquidity dulled fixed income’s safe-haven status. News that China’s central bank was freeing another $115 billion to prop up a slowing economy added to an improving outlook for economic growth, which has been fueled by easing US-Sino trade tensions. China’s factory activity expanded at a slower clip in December, pulling back from a three-year high the previous month as new orders softened. But production continued to grow at a solid pace and business confidence shot up. The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index for December eased to 51.5 from 51.8 in November, yet remained above the 50-mark that separates expansion from contraction for the fifth straight month. In another piece of positive data, the number of Americans filing claims for jobless benefits edged lower last week, helping to offset recent signs in the US labor market that new claims may be trending slightly higher.
