European stocks are expected to claw back some of their sharp losses on Friday, with Euro Stoxx 50 futures up 0.2%. In Asia, stocks were mixed as a 10% rally in Taiwanese chip heavyweight TSMC cheered some other tech shares across the region, which helped prop up the broader market with MSCI'sex-Japan Asia-Pacific index rising 0.4%. TSMC's surge came after US rival Intel signalled it may give up making its own components after falling far behind schedule developing its newest technology. "Chipmaking machine makers may see reduced demand from Intel for now but as the jump in TSMC shows, markets are not pessimistic about the semiconductor industry," said YasuoImanaka, chief analyst at Rakuten Securities. Elsewhere, there was less enthusiasm with mainland Chinese shares giving up most of their early gains, with CSI300 index last up 0.1%, after steep losses on Friday. S&P500 futures were last up 0.4% in choppy trade while Japan's Nikkei fell 0.5%. Global shares had lost steam late last week after Washington ordered China's consulate in Houston to close, prompting Beijing to react in kind by closing the US consulate in Chengdu. US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo took fresh aim at China, saying Washington and its allies must use "more creative and assertive ways" to press the Chinese Communist Party to change its ways. "US President, Donald Trump, used to say China's President, Xi Jinping is a great leader. But now Pompeo's wording is becoming so aggressive that markets are starting to worry about further escalation," said Norihiro Fujito, Chief Investment Strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. Gold rose 1.6% to a record high of $1,943 per ounce, surpassing a peak touched in September 2011, as Sino-US tensions boosted the allure of safe haven assets, especially those not tied to any specific country. The yellow metal is also helped by aggressive monetary easing around the world since the pandemic plunged the global economy into a recession. --Reuters--
