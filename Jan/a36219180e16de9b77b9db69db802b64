Several members of the coalition of politicians and activists that called the demonstrations were arrested. One protester, a student, was killed in the capital Conakry. A second youth died in the northern city of Labe. Conakry was largely deserted on Monday, with businesses, schools and markets staying closed but correspondents say it is unclear how long the population will be willing to heed calls to shut down the city. Previous demonstrations against Cond√© have been broken up by security forces leading to at least 20 deaths. --BBC--
