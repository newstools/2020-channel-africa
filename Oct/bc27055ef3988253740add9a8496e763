The win lifted Brendan Rogers' side to fourth on 12 points, while the Gunners stay in 10th place on nine after six games. Arsenal were left ruing their failure to score in the first half hour when they pushed forward time and again, racking up 10 shots and six corners to Leicester's one and zero respectively. The hosts went close when Kieran Tierney whipped in a cross that captain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang headed over the bar. They went even closer to opening the scoring a few minutes later when Alexandre Lacazette, standing in front of goal, somehow nodded another cross from Tierney wide of the far post. Vardy, who came on with half an hour to play having missed Leicester's previous two games with a calf injury, broke the deadlock in the 80th minute, heading home Cengiz Under's cross. The striker's 11th Premier League goal against Arsenal - more than any other player apart from Wayne Rooney - gave his side their first win away to Arsenal since 1973. --Reuters--
