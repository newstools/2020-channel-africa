The 25-year-old has started just once in seven league matches this season, but delivered another impressive performance in the Europa League on Thursday evening as Arsenal moved three points clear atop Group B with a 4-1 win over Molde. “Consistency, throughout the game, throughout 90 minutes, every ball, in every action and every time he’s on the ball in the final third he [needs to] make a difference,” said Arteta when asked what Pepe needs to do to start in the Premier League. “And do it more and more and more. The final product has to be better, not just from him but if you want to become a top team and score many more goals then it’s something we have to put higher demands on at the moment. Today he scored a really good goal and got an assist and he can do more. I think he’s on the right path.” Pepe has scored 11 goals and assisted a further 12 in 53 appearances across all competitions since joining the Gunners from Lille in August 2019.  --AllAfrica--
