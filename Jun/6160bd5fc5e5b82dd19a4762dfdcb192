They include a petrol-powered version of one of the United Kingdom (UK) best-selling family cars, the Nissan Qashqai. The law firm behind the case, Harcus Parker, claims that some cars produced up to 15 times the legal level of nitrogen oxides when used on the road. Both companies deny the claims. Harcus Parker says it has seen independent test data which suggests that 1.3 million diesel cars built by Nissan and its French partner Renault may have been fitted with defeat devices. These are systems which turn emissions controls on when the vehicle is being tested, but switches them off when it is being used on the road - in order to improve their performance, reliability or both. But it also claims that up to 100 000 petrol powered cars may have been affected as well. These are Nissan Qashqais fitted with a 1.2 litre engine. Emissions from diesel vehicles have come under heavy scrutiny since 2015, following a major scandal involving the German giant Volkswagen. --Reuters--
