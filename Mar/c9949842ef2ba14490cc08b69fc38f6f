IOC President, Thomas Bach, who has insisted the Games will go ahead as planned, said any decision to change an Olympic Games was not a simple matter like rescheduling a soccer match and would need careful planning and information. “The Olympic Games cannot be moved like a football game next Saturday,” he told Germany’s SWR broadcaster. “It is a complex undertaking and you can only act responsibly when you have a clear decision-making foundation.” He also ruled out cancelling the July 24 to August 9 Games. “A cancellation of the Games would be the least fair solution. A cancellation would destroy the Olympic dream of 11 000 athletes of 206 Olympic committees.” Sources told Reuters on Sunday, however, that Tokyo Games organisers had started drafting possible alternatives to holding the Olympics this summer. “Finally, we have been asked to make a simulation in case of a postponement,” a source close to the organising committee who is involved in drafting the scenarios said. “We are making alternative plans; plan B, C, D - looking at different postponement time-frames,” said the official, adding the scenarios included cost estimates for different delays. Countries have sealed borders and enforced lockdowns to fight the pandemic. The virus has killed around 13 000 people since surfacing in China at the end of last year. As the virus triggers more restrictions and claims more victims around the globe, pressure at least to delay the event is increasing. --Reuters--
