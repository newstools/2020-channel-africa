The examination body, Malawi National Examinations Board, has convened an emergency meeting after some copies of the examination papers were circulated online. Its chairperson said a decision will be announced after the meeting. The body says the leakage may not affect the outcome of examination results, but that has sparked criticism. Malawi's Times Media reports that some of the students arrested were released on bail to continue sitting examinations. More than 154 000 students began their national examinations last week. --BBC--
