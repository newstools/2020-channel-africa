Revenue from mining dropped from $2.24 million in April 2019 to just $0.33 million in April 2020 - an 85% decline year on year, according to mines ministry figures seen by Reuters. Mining accounts for more than 80% of the West African country’s export revenue, generating the lion’s share of its foreign currency reserves. “This means big trouble for Sierra Leone,” said mining minister Foday Rado Yokie. “We’re praying that things start up again [in] the next few months because this is completely debilitating to our economy.” Gold and diamond exports have ground to a halt since March 21, when Sierra Leone suspended all air traffic in an effort to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Shipments from Chinese-owned Dayu Mining, which operates the country’s largest gold mine, have been on standby for more than three weeks, said Mohammed Daffae, the company’s public relations manager.
