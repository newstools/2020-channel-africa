International cricket, like all other major sports, has come to a halt due to the coronavirus pandemic around the globe. Cricket West Indies (CWI) has recently announced their decision to suspend their domestic season for a month even though the virus has not as yet had a major impact in the Caribbean. As well as some introspection, Pollard has also urged his fellow players to be mentally and physically ready to start playing again at any given time. Pollard said on I955 FM: "It is a good time for introspection, a good time for reflection, a good time to look at where you are as an individual in your career and what you want to achieve going forward. "You have to take this time in order to do that and also keep yourself in good physical shape, and mentally as well, because when the bell rings and they say 'ok, everything is back to normal and we need to go on tour', it might not be enough time to be prepared. "But you as an individual have to be prepared mentally in order for you to try to perform at your best." Since taking over the Windies captaincy in the white-ball formats late last year, Pollard has enjoyed mixed success, with the Caribbean outfit winning 12 matches and losing 10. In their most recent outing, West Indies won each of their two T20Is against Sri Lanka although they did lose out in the ODI series.
