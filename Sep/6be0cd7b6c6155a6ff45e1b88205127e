The sale of the stakes is part of Ethiopia’s plans to open up one of the world’s last closed telecoms markets in the nation of around 110 million people. Fana said the government will retain a 55% stake in Ethio Telecom, with the remainder going to international companies. In June, the telecoms regulator said it had received 12 bids for the two telecom licences the government plans to award to multinational companies. The regulator has not given a deadline for when it will award the licences. --Reuters--
