During its congress in Brazzaville overnight on Monday, his Congolese Party of Labour (PCT) unanimously named Sessou Nguesso, 76, as its candidate for president. His re-election in 2016 sparked violence in a country where most of the five million people live below the poverty line despite huge oil reserves. "We said the choice of Denis Sassou Nguesso is an inevitable choice," top ally Leonidas Mottom told AFP. It's the choice of change in continuity, it's the choice of stability and the choice of peace," said Mottom, the party's deputy leader. The party's outgoing secretary general, Pierre Ngolo, said the 2 588 PCT congress participants reappointed Sassou Nguesso as head of the central committee in addition to naming him as their candidate in the 2021 presidential elections. According to the constitution, which was changed in 2015, Sassou has the right to run again for the presidency in 2021 and for a last time in 2026. On Thursday, the main opposition group, the Pan-African Union for Social Democracy (UPADS), said conditions were not right for Congo to organise elections in 2021. UPADS instead proposed a transition and an election in 2023 without Sassou Nguesso on the ballot. The PCT, which on Tuesday marked its 50th anniversary as a party, named 727 new members to its central committee during its congress from December 27-30. They in turn elected 78-year-old Pierre Moussa as secretary general for a five-year term, replacing Ngolo, 65, who is also president of the Senate. Moussa is an economist by training who worked for international financial institutions such as the World Bank. --News24--
