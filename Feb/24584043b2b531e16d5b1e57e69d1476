Batsman Soumya Sarkar and fast bowlers Rubel Hossain and Al-Amin Hossain have also been axed from the side who suffered an innings defeat in the Rawalpindi test. Fit-again spinner Mehidy Hasan and pace duo Mustafizur Rahman and Taskin Ahmed returned to the 16-man squad. “We felt that Mahmudullah needed a break from red ball (cricket),” Selection Panel Chairperson, Minhajul Abedin said in a statement. “Al-Amin has niggles and that’s why we thought he should be given the time to be fully ready for the limited overs matches where he is more important. Rubel is not part of our red-ball plans for the moment. Dhaka hosts the first test and Zimbabwe will also play three one-day and two Twenty20 Internationals.
