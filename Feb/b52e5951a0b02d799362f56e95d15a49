At the end of January, RaceFans.Net and Autocar revealed that the higher-ups at Daimler were meeting on February 12 to discuss Mercedes' future in F1 beyond the end of the 2020 season. Daimler quickly rubbished that such a meeting was taking place and Wolff has now had his say on the biggest rumour involving Mercedes over the course of the winter. Wolff told reporters at Mercedes' W11 livery reveal: "F1 has always been a great provider of headlines over the winter break. And by the sheer lack of racing results and the controversy on track, dropping a bombshell of a headline, always sells. "And in that respect, I'm always surprised that there's just some lunatic out there that writes something on an internet page and it's being picked up, which was a complete nonsense story, which was put straight by the CEO of Daimler the following day."
