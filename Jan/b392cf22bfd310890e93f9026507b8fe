This is due to a shortfall in revenue collection coupled with low external financing exacerbating pressure on an economy that is expected to expand by 7.1 % by June. However, the Minister for Finance and Planning Phillip Mpango is optimistic that the debt is sustainable. “All ratios are below international thresholds. The on-going debt assessment shows the country can continue to borrow locally and abroad to finance its development activities and pay off matured loans using its internal and external revenue," he said in a state of the economy address on December 31. According to Dr Mpango, the increase in debt is attributed to two factors: The matured interest loans of previous contracts and new loan disbursements to finance the standard gauge railway and airports, construction of electrical plants and implementation of water projects. “Most of the debts we are currently paying are dated 40 years back. In 2019/2020, the government intends to increase and strengthen domestic resource mobilisation aiming at financing government operations including paying debts and ensuring funds mobilised are spent as intended on projects that in turn will transform the country economically,” Dr Mpango said. The country’s external debt stands at $17.50 billion while domestic debt is at $6.25 billion as of November 30, 2019. --TheEastAfrican--
