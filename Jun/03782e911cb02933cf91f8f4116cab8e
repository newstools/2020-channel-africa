The Sudan Tribune newspaper quoted a statement from Machar's office as saying that he had been discharged on Saturday "having fully recovered". The statement further said the two government officials have been discharged after the second coronavirus confirmation tests conducted on them returned negative. “The two leaders are therefore expected to resume their daily active public office duties anytime soon, hopefully by today,” the newspaper quotes the statement as saying. --BBC--
