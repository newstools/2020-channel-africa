The investment was intended for the second phase of the treatment of the ruby-bearing ore, but the company's management thought it wise to postpone the investment given the impact of the pandemic on MRM's finances. MRM, based in the Cabo Delgado district of Montepuez, has been extracting rubies since 2012. Under normal circumstances the operations are highly profitable, but not this year. At a Maputo press conference on Thursday, the chairperson of the MRM board, Samora Machel Junior said that in the first half of 2019 the company invoiced sales for about $50 million dollars. But so far this year there have been no sales at all. An auction of rubies of mixed quality, initially scheduled for June, had been cancelled, said Machel. MRM is thus yet another victim of the chaos in international travel caused by the pandemic. In recent years, MRM's annual sales have averaged $100 million and the company had hoped that the June auction would beat all previous records. Machel admitted that he did not know whether the next auction, scheduled for December, would go ahead. --AllAfrica--
