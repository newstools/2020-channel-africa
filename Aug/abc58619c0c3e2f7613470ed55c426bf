The President, during a meeting of the High Security Council, instructed Prime Minister Abdelaziz Djerad to start by focusing on large mosques that have a capacity of 1,000 people. He said the large mosques will "be able to allow the essential physical distancing with the imperative wearing of masks by all". The prime minister will also oversee gradual reopening of public spaces, including beaches and parks, for recreation and relaxation. Mosques, beaches and parks were closed in March to prevent the spread of coronavirus. Algeria has reported approximately 30,000 cases of coronavirus. --BBC--
