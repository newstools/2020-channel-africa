Nigeria's top health official, Abdulaziz Abdullahi, told AFP that the country had received 100 000 face masks, 1 000 protective gowns and 20 000 test kits. The equipment will be distributed to frontline health workers and hospital laboratories, he said. Ma, the founder of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, has vowed to donate equal amounts of gear to all 54 countries in Africa. He has also offered the United States half a million test kits and a million masks. Health experts are worried about Nigeria's vulnerability to coronavirus because of its huge population and poor healthcare infrastructure.
