According to supersport.com, the highly-rated midfielder’s contract runs until June 2022. Having progressed through the academy ranks following his 2017 switch from Thatcham Town, Chauke has impressed both at U18 and U23 levels this season, including an appearance against Coventry City in the EFL Trophy. Speaking about his time on the South Coast, and aims for the future, the 17-year-old said: "I'm really proud because I’ve been working for this moment, so I'm pleased to see the work paying off. "It's special because growing up I've had a lot of help from my family and being able to share this with them is a proud moment. In the back of my mind I knew that if I put in the right work, this moment was achievable." Chauke spoke of his strength at the club saying: "My main attribute is hard work because without that then this process wouldn't be possible. "Being at this club everything is put towards development on the pitch even in education, everything has come together on the pitch to help me perform." Southampton Academy director Matt Hale praised Chauke for his hard work. "Kegs has shown tremendous progress since joining from his U15 season. He has learnt so much and showed a real curiosity to develop. He has strong listening skills, an acceptance to take on information and apply his learning really well in games. "The coaches enjoy working with him and I’m looking forward to watching him develop further over the new few years."
