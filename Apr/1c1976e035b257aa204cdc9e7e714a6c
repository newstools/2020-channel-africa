“In compliance, the suspension of all athletics activities is therefore also extended,” announced Aleck Skhosana, President of ASA. “This will remain in place until is it deemed safe for us to resume by the national government. This affects all fixtures and programmes from March 26 until  April 30. We will review our position when the government issues new measures to be followed. “As a responsible national federation, ASA accepts that the protection of all lives outweighs everything else. We also note that everyone is affected the same way by this law and this include athletes, coaches, event organisers, athletes’ representatives, administrators and communities. “As it stands, however, let us prioritise the safety and health of every person, so that we can all return to our athletics programmes once it is considered safe to do so. We urge everyone to join hands with the Government to fight this pandemic by obeying regulations of the lockdown. --News24--
