Failure by the police to act against the farmers has been criticised by South Africans who took to social media to express their anger. Pandemonium erupted at the Senekal Magistrates Court where two suspects, Sekwetje Isaiah Mahlamba (32) and Sekola Piet Matlaetsa (44), arrested for the murder of Brendin Horner (22), appeared. The case against Mahlamba and Matlaetsa was postponed to October 16. Horner was murdered and found tied to a pole at Die Rots farm in Paul Roux, a small town near Senekal. Police said soon after the murder case was postponed, the farmers forced their way into court in an attempt to storm the police cells and avenge the death of Horner. South Africa’s Minister of Police Bheki Cele condemned the violent protest, which he described as lawlessness, and called on those who violated the law to be arrested. Cele said there was no logic in the burning of a police vehicle, which was the same resource that is meant to assist the farmers with their own security Thoko Didiza, the Minister of Agriculture said the government sympathised with farmers and farm workers but emphasised that any form of destruction of property and violence was unacceptable. Ernst Roets, head of policy and action for civil rights group AfriForum, said the farmers converged on Senekal from all over South Africa in solidarity with the Horner family. The South African farming community has been involved in many protests to highlight the lack of security and the high rate of murders in the country’s farms. The demonstrations by farmers have included the blocking of roads in Pretoria and several other towns in the Mpumalanga Province. The Economic Freedom Front has called on the police to against those who overturned and torched a police vehicle.  --TheAfricanMirror--
