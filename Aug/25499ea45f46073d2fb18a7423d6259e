Three men were fined about $50,000 each. They are thought to be part of a syndicate accused of hijacking an oil tanker off the coast of Equatorial Guinea in March and securing a $20,000 ransom for the crew. But the men won’t serve jail time for those charges. Analysts say the law isn’t strong enough to act as a deterrent. Last year Lagos alone recorded 11 kidnappings, the highest number of any port in the world.
