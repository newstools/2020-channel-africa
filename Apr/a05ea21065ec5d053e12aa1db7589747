Trump, who has reacted angrily to accusations his administration’s response to the worst epidemic in a century was haphazard and too slow, had become increasingly hostile towards the United Nations agency before announcing the halt on Tuesday. The WHO, which is based in Geneva, had promoted China’s “disinformation” about the virus that likely led to a wider outbreak than otherwise would have occurred, Trump said. WHO had failed to investigate credible reports from sources in China’s Wuhan province, where the virus was first identified in December, that conflicted with Beijing’s accounts about the spread and “parroted and publicly endorsed” the idea that human to human transmission was not happening, Trump said. “The WHO failed in this basic duty and must be held accountable,” Trump told a White House news conference on Tuesday. A US official told Reuters that Trump made the move despite pushback within his administration, especially from top health advisers. There was no immediate reaction from the WHO, which has been appealing for more than $1 billion to fund operations against the pandemic. The US is the biggest overall donor to the WHO, contributing more than $400 million in 2019, roughly 15% of its budget. Nearly 2 million people globally have been infected and more than 127 000 have died since the disease emerged in China late last year, according to a Reuters tally. UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres said it was not the time to reduce resources for the WHO. “Now is the time for unity and for the international community to work together in solidarity to stop this virus and its shattering consequences,” he said in a statement. China, which has won WHO praise for its actions to curb the virus’s spread, urged the United States on Wednesday to fulfil its obligations to the WHO. “This decision weakens the WHO’s capability and harms international cooperation,” Foreign Ministry Spokesperson, Zhao Lijian said. European Union Foreign Policy Chief, Josep Borrell said on Twitter: “Deeply regret US decision to suspend funding to WHO. There is no reason justifying this move at a moment when their efforts are needed more than ever.” German Foreign Minister, Heiko Maas, said apportioning blame did not help. “The virus knows no borders,” Maas said on Twitter. New Zealand Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern said the WHO was essential to tackling the pandemic. “At a time like this when we need to be sharing information and we need to have advice we can rely on, the WHO has provided that,” she said. “We will continue to support it and continue to make our contributions.” Australian Prime Minister, Scott Morrison said he sympathised with Trump’s criticisms of the WHO, especially its “unfathomable” support of re-opening China’s “wet markets”, where freshly slaughtered, and live, animals are sold. “But that said, the WHO also as an organisation does a lot of important work including here in our region in the Pacific and we work closely with them,” Morrison told an Australian radio station. “We are not going to throw the baby out of with the bathwater here, but they are also not immune from criticism.” John Sawers, the former head of Britain’s MI6 foreign intelligence service, said China concealed crucial information about the outbreak from the rest of the world and that it would be better to hold China responsible rather than the WHO. In its latest Strategy Update, the WHO said countries that ease restrictions should wait at least two weeks to evaluate the impact before easing again. It said that the world stands at a “pivotal juncture”. More than 2 200 people died in the United States on Tuesday, a record toll according to a Reuters tally, even as it debated how to reopen its economy. New York City, hardest hit by the outbreak, revised its death toll sharply up to more than 10 000, to include victims presumed to have died of the lung disease but never tested. US health advocacy group, Protect Our Care said Trump’s WHO funding withdrawal was “a transparent attempt to distract from his history downplaying the severity of the coronavirus crisis and his administration’s failure to prepare our nation. To be sure, the WHO is not without fault but it is beyond irresponsible to cut its funding at the height of a global pandemic,” said Leslie Dach, who chairs the group. Trump, who has declared he will decide when to lift US lockdowns, suggested some Democratic state governors were “mutineers” after New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said he would refuse any order that risked reigniting the outbreak. --Reuters--
