The airline, the largest in Africa, said the insurance scheme, dubbed Sheba Comfort, is part of the carrier’s “extra security measure to protect passengers and ensure that they travel with peace of mind.” The cover includes costs for repatriation, evacuation, and quarantine for all passengers booked with the airline’s tickets on its international flights from October 1, 2020, to March 31, 2021. “Passengers will have their medical expenses up to $117 500 covered if they are diagnosed with Covid-19 during their travel, in addition to quarantine costs up to $175.73 per day for a maximum of 14 days,” Ethiopian Airlines said in a statement. Sheba Comfort also includes repatriation and evacuation services besides daily assistance through the airline’s hotline. “We are glad to be among the pioneer global airlines to introduce this extra security measure and provide global cover for Covid-19 with a view to boosting passengers’ confidence,” said the airline’s Group CEO Tewolde GebreMariam. --TheEastAfrican--
