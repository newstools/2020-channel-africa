Over the weekend, three traditional leaders were kidnapped in the country’s South-West region and one in the neighbouring North-West region. Two of them have been killed, according to South-West Governor, Bernard Okalia Bilai. In a tweet on Monday, human rights lawyer and activist, Felix Agbor Nkongho, describes the abductions and killings of the traditional rulers as "an affront to our traditions, customs and culture". Authorities have blamed the spate of kidnappings on separatist fighters, but the separatists have not claimed responsibility. However, separatists had threatened to kidnap and possibly kill any traditional leader who took part in the country’s first regional elections held earlier this month. The current attacks on village chiefs are seen as the carrying out of that threat. --BBC--
