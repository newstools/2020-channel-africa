At the same time, Mnuchin said in an interview with Fox Business Network that plane-maker Boeing Co (BA.N) has not requested government help. “I’ve been very clear this is not an airline bailout,” Mnuchin said. “And that taxpayers need to be compensated for relief they’re giving to airlines.” United States (US) airlines are preparing to tap the government for up to $25 billion in grants to cover payroll in a sharp travel downturn triggered by the coronavirus, even after the government warned it may take stakes in exchange for bailout funds, people familiar with the matter said. Mnuchin can demand equity, warrants or other financial instruments in order to “provide appropriate compensation to the federal government.” A Treasury spokeswoman declined to comment on a report that Mnuchin would demand equity. Airlines can ask for the equivalent of their payroll between April 1 and September 30, according to the terms of the bill, meaning some large airlines could get $4 billion or more in total.
