Family member William Erio told a funeral mass, broadcast on state television, that he wanted to dispel rumours that Mkapa had been infected with coronavirus. No cause was given when the death of the 81-year-old was announced on Friday. He was the third president of Tanzania, leading the country from 1995 to 2005. Tanzania has stopped publishing statistics on Covid-19 cases and the current leader, John Magufuli, has been accused of covering up the scale of the problem. Officially there have been just over 521 deaths in Tanzania - far fewer than in neighbouring countries. --BBC--
