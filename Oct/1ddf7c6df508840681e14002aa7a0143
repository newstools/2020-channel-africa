Details of the kidnapping, on the border with Nigeria, were not immediately clear. Niger, like much of West Africa’s Sahel region, is struggling with a deepening security crisis as groups with links to al Qaeda and Islamic State carry out attacks on the army and civilians, despite help from French and United States (US) forces. Four US soldiers were killed in an ambush there in 2017, sparking a national debate about America’s role fighting Islamists in the sparsely populated West African desert that is home to some of the world’s poorest countries. Attacks in Niger, like the one on the US forces, have generally been restricted to a western zone bordering Mali and Burkina Faso, but there have been signs of encroachment in 2020. In August, gunmen on motorcycles killed six French aid workers, a Nigerian guide and a driver in a giraffe reserve just 65 kilometres from the capital Niamey.
