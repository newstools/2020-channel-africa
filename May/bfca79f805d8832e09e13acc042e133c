Thomas Thabane told a national television audience that although he had not completed his work, he was retiring from what he described as the great theatre of action. He had for months refused to step down. Thabane and his wife, Lipolelo, were embroiled in a bitter divorce when she was shot dead outside her home. His current wife, Maesaiah, has been charged with murdering Lipolelo. The couple deny wrongdoing. --BBC--
