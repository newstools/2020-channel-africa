The US has reported fresh daily records for new COVID-19 case hospitalisations this week, prompting cities and states, including Chicago, Detroit and California, to re-impose public health restrictions. European officials have also warned against complacency and said measures to control infections must continue despite hopes that vaccines under development could help to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus. US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Thursday during a discussion with other central bankers that progress in developing a coronavirus vaccine was welcome news but that near-term economic risks remain as infections accelerate, underscoring the likely need for additional government stimulus. Against that grim backdrop, MSCI's broadest index of Asian shares outside Japan dipped 0.25% in early trade as shares across the region stumbled. Chinese blue-chips led losses, falling 1.21%. Australian shares lost 0.47%, Seoul's Kospi was down 0.16% and the Hang Seng was 0.55% lower. Japan's Nikkei 225 fell 0.95%. Some investors saw a buying opportunity in the slump. --Reuters--
