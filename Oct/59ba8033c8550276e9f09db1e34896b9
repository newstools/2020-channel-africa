BP said underlying replacement cost profit, its definition of net income, was $86 million from July to September. That was down from $2.2 billion a year earlier, but a big improvement on its massive second-quarter loss of $6.7 billion. Chief executive Bernard Looney said that despite a "challenging environment", the firm was "performing while transforming". He added that despite financial pressures, BP would continue to pay a dividend to shareholders. In February, BP said it planned sharp cuts in carbon emissions by 2050. The company wants to be "net zero" by 2050 - that is, it wants the greenhouse gas emissions from its operations, and from the oil and gas it produces, to make no addition to the amount of greenhouse gases in the world's atmosphere by that date. It also wants to halve the amount of carbon in its products by 2050.
