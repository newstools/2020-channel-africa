The directorate of criminal investigations said the predators were luring children by complimenting them through inbox messages, before asking them for nude photos. The agency said it was investigating several cases and asked parents to share information if a perpetrator contacts their children. It also urged them to track the online activities of their children and always know their whereabouts as some perpetrators were organising for physical meetings. Students with access to internet in the country have been attending online classes after schools were closed down in March to prevent the spread of coronavirus. --BBC--
