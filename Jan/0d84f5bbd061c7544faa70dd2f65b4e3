The government of Zimbabwe donated land to the bank in 2017 for the  project. Egypt headquartered Afreximbank, which has been one of the biggest  financiers of Zimbabwe’s economic development programmes in light of  dried up international financial support, said at the time it would use  the Harare office as the first to implement a new concept under which it  transforms its buildings into one stop trade services shops. On Tuesday, the bank invited contractors’ interested in taking part in  the building project to submit expressions of interest. “The 20 000 square meter iconic mixed-use business complex shall  provide an integrated one-stop shop for trade facilitation and  information services and trade finance and offer a range of facilities,  corporate office space, conference and exhibition centre, innovation and  incubation hub, knowledge centre, hotel, retail etcetera,” Afreximbank  said. Established in 1993, Afreximbank’s mission is to “stimulate a consistent expansion, diversification and development of African trade,  while operating as a first class, profit-oriented, socially responsible  financial institution and a centre of excellence in African trade  matters.” The bank is currently led by Benedict Oramah, who is its president and chairperson. Besides Afreximbank, Zimbabwe also houses the southern Africa headquarters of the Trade and Development Bank, formerly known as the  PTA Bank, which is the financial arm for the Common Market for Eastern  and Southern Africa. --Herald--
