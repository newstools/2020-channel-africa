The move mimics the United States (US) tech giant's rivals Facebook and Twitter, which have also said remote work would be a permanent option. It follows a rapid shift away from office working prompted by the coronavirus pandemic. Many companies are reconsidering how much office space they need, expecting a long-term increase in remote staff. Microsoft said some roles will continue to require an in-person presence, such as those needing access to hardware, the firm added. But many staff will also be able to work from home part-time, without needing formal approval from their managers. "Our goal is to evolve the way we work over time with intentionâ€”guided by employee input, data, and our commitment to support individual work styles and business needs while living our culture," a Microsoft spokesperson said of the new guidance, which she said would apply to United Kingdom (UK) staff as well. As of April 2020, more than 46% of those employed were doing some work from home, according to the Office of National Statistics. That was comparable to the US, where 42% of the workforce was remote in May 2020, according to Stanford University economics professor Nicholas Bloom, whose research looked at people aged 20-64, earning more than $10 000 in 2019. While that share decreased to about 35% in August, it still marked a major change. Before the pandemic, just 2% of workers were remote full time, he said.
