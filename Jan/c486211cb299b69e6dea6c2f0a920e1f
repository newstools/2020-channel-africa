Speaking during a tour of the Small Enterprises Development Company (SEDCO), Khumalo said having declared 2020 a year for SMEs in Eswatini, he felt it is necessary for Emaswati to support SMEs, especially during the back to school period. “As we draw closer to the re-opening of schools around the country, parents and guardians will be busy with securing school requirements for their children such as uniform, stationery and other items. This year I have declared that it is a year for SMEs in Eswatini. As a ministry, we wish to focus much of our effort into identifying growth opportunities for the SME sector,” he said. He further stated that they were driven by the belief that a thriving SME sector could make a significant contribution to sustainable economic growth, job creation and subsequently poverty alleviation. “I would also like to take this opportunity to appeal to both buyers and sellers to transact in harmony during this engaging period and to all players in the education materials supply chain, to support SMEs for their school requirements. In the same vein, I encourage the SMEs themselves to supply quality products and ensure customer satisfaction in order to guarantee repeat business,” he added. The Back to School campaign run by SEDCO is aimed at encouraging the nation to support SMEs dealing with school merchandise. SEDCO, through the ‘Business Incubation Programme,’ incubated a number of SMEs who manufacture quality and affordable school products such as uniforms; jerseys, tracksuits, neckties, shirts, and beverages such as fruit juice and bottled water. The incubated SMEs are found at the SEDCO Nhlangano Estate, Mbabane Estate at the Industrial Site, Sidwashini Estate and Manzini Estate; adjacent the old Metro Cash & Carry building. --EswatiniObserver--
