The politician, who normally goes by the name Adolf Uunona, got 85% of the votes in last month's election in Ompundja, a small town in the far north of the country. In the candidates' list, Hitler was reduced to an initial. But the official results list his full name. Namibia is a former German colony and there are still reminders of that time in some place names. There is also a small German-speaking minority. "My father named me after this man. He probably didn't understand what Adolf Hitler stood for," Uunona told Bild. "It was a very normal name for me as a child. It was not until I was growing up that I realised that this man wanted to subjugate the whole world. I have nothing to do with any of these things.‚Äù The German occupation of Namibia, which ended after World War One and pre-dated Hitler's rise to power, has bitter memories for the people there. Between 1904 and 1908, German colonial forces killed more than 80% of Namibia's Nama and Herero populations in what historians now call "the forgotten genocide". --BBC--
