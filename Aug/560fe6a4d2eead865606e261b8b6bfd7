Two ethnic groups, Beni Amer and Beja, clashed over the nomination of Governor Salah Ammar of the Beni Amer community. Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok has sent a ministerial delegation to the state. The acting governor Arbab El Fadul has imposed a three-day curfew in the state and police have been deployed to enforce it. Supporters of the new governor want him to quickly arrive in Kassala and assume office, while the rival ethnic community has rejected his appointment. The disputed governor in his Eid al-Adha address said his arrival had been delayed because of the protests over his nomination. Prime Minister Hamdok appointed 18 civilian governors sparking tribal rivalries in some states. --BBC--
