Local officials believed the three attacks, between Tuesday night and Wednesday evening, had been carried out by Islamist militants, who often say they are defending Fulani herders against rival Dogon farmers. As Islamist militant violence has spread from the north of Mali to the centre of the country, this has fuelled reprisal killings between herding and farming communities. The army has in recent years been criticised by rights groups and residents for failing to protect civilians in central Mali. --BBC--
