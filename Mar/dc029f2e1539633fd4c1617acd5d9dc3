The original fixture for the final round in 2020 tournament was scheduled for Saturday, February 14 in Paris but has been called off because of coronavirus. "The match is expected to be played on either October 30 or 31, it's what we have understood," Ibanez said at a press conference. Competition leaders England's trip to Italy this weekend has also been postponed as was the Azzurri's visit to Dublin which was set for March 7. Scotland's visit to Wales this weekend will go ahead. The final round of action will decide the title winners with England, France, Scotland and Ireland still in with a chance of outright victory. Ibanez also said prop Mohamed Haouas will go in front a disciplinary panel in London on Wednesday after being sent off in the weekend loss away to Scotland for punching the hosts' Jamie Ritchie.
