The African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA) was formally launched just over a year ago in a blaze of optimism. The accord, styled as the biggest free-trade accord in the world in terms of population, gathers 54 out of 55 African countries, with Eritrea the only holdout. It aims to phase out all tariffs on commerce on the continent of 1.2-billion people, a goal that backers say could give trade a mega-jolt as only 15% of trade by African nations is with continental neighbours compared to 70% with Europe. A new date for January 2021 has been proposed by ambassadors at the Africa Unionâ€™s headquarters in Addis Ababa. The recommendation has yet to be adopted by heads of state. --BusinessDayLive--
