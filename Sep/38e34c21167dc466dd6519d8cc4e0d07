The new stable rates generated by the auction system in the past month are emphasised by the movements of well under 1% over the past four auctions following movements in the first eight auctions. With the Zimbabwe dollar now only a few cents below the mid-August rate as a result of these tiny four changes, the process of price discovery in an open market system has produced general agreement within very narrow limits of just what the local currency is worth for normal international trade. In the last four auctions, the Zimbabwe Dollar moved down 0.43%, then down another 0. 58%, then up 0 094% last week and now up by another 0.746% to produce a cumulative move down over the four weeks of 0.016%, roughly a sixth of one percent, or a total of just under 14 cents. These tiny changes have resulted in minimal price movements, a few prices falling slightly as a result of lower inflation expectations, and the less common small rises driven by a rise in real costs. Zupco fares are the only common item that has seen a major jump, probably in a catch-up process. Yesterday’s main auction saw 185 successful bidders allocated $18 334 530.08 with another 31 bids disqualified because bidders were trying to pay for goods or services not on the import priority list, according to the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, or had not cleared paperwork by the deadlines for previous exports and imports. In the SMEs auction, 59 valid bidders shared $876 674.44, with another 15 disqualified for the same reasons. This is the first time the Reserve Bank has listed non-adherence to the priority list as the main reason for disqualifications. Some bids were allotted pro-rata to ensure that allotments conformed to the import priority list. No valid bid was rejected in full. --Herald--
