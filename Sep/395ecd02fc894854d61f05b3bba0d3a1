Climate experts said Zimbabweans must be conditioned to prepare for flash floods, violent storms, tropical cyclones and floods in low-lying areas as climate change brings ever more frequent bouts of extreme weather. Prof Desmond Manatsa, a climate science expert at Bindura University of Science Education, said that Zimbabweans needed to reconsider the risks given that wetter conditions are expected this season. “I do concur with the national forecast to some extent,” he said. “The Pacific Ocean had a La Nina and the Indian Ocean Dipole is negative, both conducive for a normal to above normal rainfall amounts. The methodology which we use for our national forecast is only able to predict total amounts, but has no capacity to incorporate variations within a season.” With heavy rains predicted, climate experts warn that homes, roads and other infrastructure could be flooded quickly, with damage to some buildings from floodwater, lightning strikes, hail or strong winds unless drains are cleared out and other precautions taken. Flooded rivers could cause danger to life while sudden flooding could lead to difficult driving conditions, clogging of water drains and chances that some communities become cut off by flooded roads and rivers. “Our climate adaptation policies should not be kept on our shelves, but must be implemented to help the most vulnerable to better cope with extreme conditions such as droughts and floods,” said a government climate expert. “This latest flood or heavy rain warning should serve as an opportunity for Zimbabwe and other governments in the region to take heed of the warnings coming from our weather experts to prepare for the worst.” Zimbabwe has increasingly seen more severe floods in recent decades.  --Herald--
