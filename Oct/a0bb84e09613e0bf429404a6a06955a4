Governor Saleh Ammar's appointment sparked ethnic protests in the province that barred him from reporting to work. He had to stay in the country's capital, Khartoum, as protesters from the rival Beja community demonstrated for weeks. The governor is from the Beni Amr community. The protests had turned deadly with several people reported to have died. Sudan's main port was blocked by the protesters for three days last week. The protesters had also forced the closure of the road linking the eastern city of Port Sudan to Khartoum. Governor Ammar's sacking on Tuesday sparked fresh protests in the province as members of his community cried foul, according to Associated Press. Prime Minister Hamdok appointed 18 civilian governors sparking ethnic rivalries in some states.
