Oil markets also rose after Saudi Arabia suggested it and other oil producers could adjust its current supply-cut pact, perhaps taking more barrels off the market if demand slumps in the winter as infections rise and before the vaccine are widely available. Fuel demand is down worldwide as a result of the pandemic, and with infections now surpassing 50 million globally, numerous nations, especially in Europe, are reimposing lockdowns to slow the virus’s spread. The vaccine news gave traders hope that the pandemic could be tamped down next year, which would help people resume normal life, boosting demand. “Oil particularly reacted to the news because of what it means,” said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital in New York. “The pandemic is hitting transportation terrifically and 80% of crude oil barrels go to transportation fuel, so I think this is a logical response.” Both contracts rose more than $4 earlier in the session as traders sought to unwind bearish bets. Brent and WTI traded 148% and 139% of last session’s volumes, respectively. Pfizer said its experimental vaccine was more than 90% effective in preventing Covid-19, based on initial data, a victory in the battle against a pandemic that has forced lockdowns around the world. --Reuters--
