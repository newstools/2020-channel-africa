The anti-corruption campaigner fell ill during a flight and the plane made an emergency landing in Omsk, Spokesperson Kira Yarmysh said adding that they suspected something had been mixed into his tea. The hospital said Navalny was in a stable but serious condition. Navalny, 44, is a staunch critic of President Vladimir Putin. In June he described a vote on constitutional reforms as a "coup" and a "violation of the constitution". The reforms allow Putin to serve another two terms in office. On Wednesday, Yarmysh tweeted that Navalny was on a ventilator and in a coma, and that the hospital was now full of police officers. She said doctors were initially ready to share any information but were now saying the toxicology tests were delayed and were "clearly playing for time, and not saying what they know". She said in a tweet at 14:58 local time (08:58 GMT) that Navalny's condition had not changed and he was still unconscious. She was told the diagnosis would be "towards evening". --BBC--
