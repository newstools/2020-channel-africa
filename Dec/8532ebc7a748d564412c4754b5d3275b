The new cases were out of the 5 578 samples tested for the novel coronavirus over the past 24 hours, the country's Health Ministry said in a statement. One new COVID-19 death was registered, bringing the cumulative number of deaths to 207. A total of 199 new recoveries were recorded in the East African country, with the total recoveries up to 9 374, said the Ministry. Meanwhile, Ugandan President, Yoweri Museveni, has warned that the pandemic situation in the country is getting worse. According to a State House statement issued here late on Monday, Museveni urged politicians and the public to strictly follow standard operating procedures, including wearing masks while in public, washing hands with soap and water, sanitizing, and maintaining social distancing, in efforts to fight the disease. The country has in recent weeks witnessing political campaign events as the January 14 general elections draw near. Observers warn that the pandemic is likely to quickly spread as politicians make processions, attracting huge crowds. "Those who are mobilising people in crowds during this pandemic of COVID-19 are enemies," said Museveni, who is running for another term as president. --Xinhua--
