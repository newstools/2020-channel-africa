The ban was effected yesterday to minimise social disorder and allow shops to sell only “essential” products during the shutdown. President Mnangagwa last week declared a national 21-day lockdown to curb the spread of Covid-19 that will run until April 16. The virus has infected over a million people worldwide, killing over 50 000. In Zimbabwe there are nine confirmed cases of Covid-19 and one death. Police have been deployed in full force to take action on shops that defy the ban. A snap survey by our Bulawayo Bureau yesterday showed that shops around town had stopped selling alcohol, although the shelves and fridges were full to the brim. National police spokesperson Paul Nyathi said the measure came as rowdy citizens were defying social distancing measures. He urged citizens to stay indoors to protect themselves and their families. “People should take heed of Covid-19 and put their health first and that of every citizen in the country as the pandemic is affecting all of us,” he said. --Herald--
