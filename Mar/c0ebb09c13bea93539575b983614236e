Addressing the media in Pretoria, South Africa, Bonakele said the administrative delays in spectrum allocation, which can ensure further price reductions come at a high cost to the economy. His comments follow an announcement on a settlement agreement with Vodacom which agreed to reduce data prices by over 30% across all channels from April 1. “It is crucial that spectrum be released. We’ve said this in our report, and it’s not a new thing.  We were critical of the prices with or without spectrum being allocated.” “But I think we were absolutely clear that spectrum must be released without delay, it is a cost to our economy, and it is a cost to the efficiency of the entire country,” Bonakele further explains.
