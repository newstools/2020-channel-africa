The latest cases were identified during 229 new tests, health department's Abdellatif Mekki said on Wednesday. “It is still possible to protect ourselves,” he said, noting that local infections now outnumber those who recently travelled in from epicentres of the outbreak. At times appearing frustrated as he addressed the media and the public, the health Minister appealed yet again to people to adhere to the terms of the lockdown. He also criticised people who have violated self-quarantine rules. “The question is, where are we headed? Where are we headed if the police and army today have to tell you 'please go to your homes'. Can the country continue like this?. The situation in Tunisia can not sustain this…” he said. Tunisia imposed a nationwide lockdown that came into effect on Sunday. Its airspace and land borders have been closed since last week.
