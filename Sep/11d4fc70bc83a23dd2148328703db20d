Rusesabagina was played by Don Cheadle in the Oscar-nominated film ‘Hotel Rwanda’, which told how hotel manager Rusesabagina used his job and his connections with the Hutu elite to protect Tutsis fleeing the slaughter. Rwandan police said Rusesabagina, who has called for armed resistance to the government, was arrested on terrorism charges on an international arrest warrant. His family dispute that. “He was kidnapped and taken by extraordinary rendition to Rwanda,” his daughter Carine Kanimba posted on Facebook. The spokesperson for the Rwanda Investigation Bureau did not respond to a request for comment. The ministers for justice and foreign affairs did not respond to messages seeing comment. Another daughter, Anaise, told the BBC World Service radio that her father had last called them on Thursday from Dubai. “I believe he was kidnapped because he would never go to Rwanda on his own will,” Anaise told the BBC. Rusesabagina moved abroad after the genocide and won worldwide acclaim, receiving the United States’ highest civilian award, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, in 2005. 

But some genocide survivors and President Paul Kagame have disputed Rusesabagina’s account of rescuing Tutsis or accused him of exploiting the genocide for commercial gain.
