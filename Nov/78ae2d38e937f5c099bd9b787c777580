Traffic was brought to a halt when bandits opened fire on a bus. Two people were reported killed and nine abducted during Sunday's attack, but the state government in Kaduna says the hostages were later freed in an army operation. Correspondents say there's lawlessness in several parts of Nigeria, where bandits demand ransoms. In a separate incident, a former international footballer, Christian Obodo, is reported to have been abducted in the south-east. He was kidnapped once before eight years ago but released unharmed. --BBC--
