“We experienced prices that had never been there before and we are running at a loss” along with private operators, Awow Daniel Chuang, the undersecretary in the Ministry of Petroleum, said in an interview in Juba, the capital. “We have been affected much more than others because South Sudan, being a new country just emerging from war, has a lot of challenges.”

South Sudan’s official oil production dropped 20 000 barrels to 170 000 barrels a day as lockdowns to control the pandemic delay the moving of production equipment and materials. The commodity is the landlocked, East African nation’s only major export and its success is crucial to an economy shattered by five years of conflict. Plans to boost output have also been delayed because the nation is an OPEC+ participant that’s expected to contribute to the cartel’s wider supply-cut effort.

“We have been getting pressure from OPEC and, of course, we understand the background of this and we are working also to balance our needs, and at the same time cooperate,” Chuang said. “We are always making sure that we cooperate with OPEC so that we control the supply.” Oil prices remain around $40 a barrel as investors weigh demand through the on-going pandemic. The country that gained independence from Sudan less than a decade ago pays fees to its northern neighbour to get its oil to ports. It has negotiated to defer $6 a barrel of the $24.10 a barrel it costs to ship the crude, Chuang said. --Bloomberg--
