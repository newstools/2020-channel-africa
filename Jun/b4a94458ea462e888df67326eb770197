Arsenal have reportedly offered Roma winger Justin Kluivert a lucrative four-year contract in a bid to convince him to make the switch to the Emirates. Reports claim the Gunners are keen on the 21-year-old, with Roma looking to balance the books this summer through sales.Â 

The Serie A side announced debts of over $251 million in May and they could sell Kluivert and Nicolo Zaniolo, among others. According to Calciomercato, talks between both clubs began some time ago, with Arsenal now stepping up the negotiations. The Gunners have offered Kluivert a four-year contract that will see the winger earn more than double his current salary, the report claims. Kluivert, the son of Netherlands legend Patrick, is reportedly itching to move to Arsenal ahead of next season. Roma would be keen for Arsenal's transfer offer to reach $35 million, although the Gunners could sweeten the deal. Henrikh Mkhitaryan has spent the season in Rome on loan and could be included to lower the price for Kluivert. Roma will reportedly use the monies earned to push through talks to sign Pedro from Chelsea. The winger is out of contract at the end of the season and the Blues have not offered him a new deal, with Hakim Ziyech and Timo Werner moving to Stamford Bridge. Arsenal, like most clubs, will operate on a restricted budget when the transfer window re-opens due to football's recent shutdown. However, Gunners boss Mikel Arteta has confirmed his intention to improve his squad. He insisted that the gap between his team and the likes of Manchester City and Liverpool will not close if he does not take action.
