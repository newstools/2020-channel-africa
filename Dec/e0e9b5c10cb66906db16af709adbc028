The repatriation of the 200 refugees was overseen by UNHCR representative in Cameroon, Olivier Guillaume Beer, in the presence of Cameroon's local government representative, Laurence Diyen Jam. "We plan to repatriate at least 1,500 CAR refugees from Cameroon by the end of December," Mr Beer said. The CAR has faced instability since gaining independence from France in 1960. It is holding national elections later this month. --BBC--
