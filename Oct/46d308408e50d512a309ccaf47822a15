The election commission released fresh results late on Thursday which showed the 82-year-old President to be the clear leader in the race. He has a lead of 1.2 million votes with 37 of 38 electoral districts counted, Reuters news agency reports. But the main opposition candidate, Cellou Dalein Diallo, has complained of large-scale fraud and has declared himself the winner. There has been widespread violence in Guinea since the election and after Condé's controversial decision earlier this year to seek a third term, which required a change to the constitution. --BBC—
