Burundi said on Friday they will not be calling up any players from Europe for their designated matches against Mauritania on 25 and 29 March. "This measure is taken because of the 14 days of quarantine needed to enter Burundi, after having been in Europe," Burundi's federation said in a statement. "The federation calls on Caf to analyse the measures needed to allow the participation of all eligible players in these matches." Burundi follows The Gambia in complaining about the possibility of being forced to play games when some first-team players are ineligible for selection. --BBC--
