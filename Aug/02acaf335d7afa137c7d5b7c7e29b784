The record slump, after a 2.2% drop in the first three months of the year, also outstripped the United States (US) downturn and officially pushed Britain into its first recession since 2009. It follows a report Tuesday that showed hundreds of thousands of people have lost their jobs. The figures add to evidence Britain is paying a heavy price for being slower than most of its peers to enter a lockdown in March. The country also has Europeâ€™s highest death toll from the coronavirus. The drop in GDP exceeded the 18.5% recorded in Spain, the worst-performing country in the European Union. The US economy shrank 9.5% in the same period. While a recovery is under way as restrictions are eased, UK output jumped 8.7% in June, there are worrying signs that it could soon run out of steam. Localised jumps in infections have heightened concerns over more shutdowns, government wage support is being phased out, and companies face higher tariffs should Britain fail to agree a trade deal with the European Union by the end of the year. The Bank of England has highlighted the labour market as a key concern, with officials fearing a jump in unemployment when government job support is withdrawn later in 2020. Data Tuesday showed the number of employees on payrolls is already down around 730 000 compared with March. --BBC--
