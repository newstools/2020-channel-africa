The two countries, together with Sudan, resumed talks last week to solve the long-standing impasse on the Grand Renaissance Dam, which Ethiopia is building. Egypt fears the project will allow Ethiopia to control the flow of Africa's longest river. Speaking to journalists in Addis Ababa on Tuesday, Ethiopia's Foreign Affairs Minister Gedu Andargachew accused Cairo of obstinacy. He said Egypt is engaging in the talks while simultaneously reaching out to the UN.
