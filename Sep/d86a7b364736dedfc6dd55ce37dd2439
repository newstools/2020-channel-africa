He has been in police custody since Saturday. Rukutana is accused of shooting and injuring an opponent's supporter, after he lost the election in the ruling National Resistance Movement party's primaries. In a statement published by the state-owned New Vision newspaper, Rukutana's lawyers denied he had fired a shot. "The weapons of the minister's guard and his weapons were all retrieved by the police and are available for inspection, and the truth shall be established that the weapons never released any bullet nor is there a shell of any bullet at the scene," the statement said. Rukutana was seeking to run as the party's parliamentary candidate in the 2021 general election.

Rukutana was also charged with assault, threatening violence and causing damage to property. A video clip has been circulating on social media allegedly showing him grabbing a gun from one of his bodyguards, and aiming it at people inside a car. A voice inside the car can be heard saying in a local language that "Rukutana is going to shoot us". Rukutana's lawyers said he had secured a weapon "to scare away the armed people in the car that had blocked the road and also to protect himself and his son". The ruling party elections, which were conducted by voters lining up behind the candidates, were characterized by several incidents of violence across the country. In some areas, voting was cancelled.
A number of cabinet ministers and prominent politicians lost the party vote.On Monday morning, President Yoweri Museveni, who is the party chairman, released a statement referring to those who caused chaos during the election as "shallow crooks". He added that Rukutana should be prosecuted.The former Deputy Attorney General, who represented the government in prominent court cases including election petitions, has been photographed in the past carrying an AK-47 rifle while grazing his cows.
