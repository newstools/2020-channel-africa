De Villiers made his debut for the Brisbane Heat early in January and participated in six BBL games. The 35-year-old scored 146 runs at an average of 24.33 with a highest score of 71 off 37 balls against the Melbourne Stars. The South African also stood as wicketkeeper for two games and claimed a stumping and a catch. The Heat failed to advance through to the playoffs and ended seventh in the BBL standings. "Let's hope so, obviously it's quite a long way away still but I would love to come back," he told Channel 7. "They (Heat) looked after me like I was one of their own." De Villiers hailed the BBL and stated that Australian cricket is in really good hands. "I had so much fun, I wish I could've been here from the start. It's a great set-up at the Brisbane Heat," said De Villiers. "The BBL itself is a great product ... I enjoyed every minute of it with the fantastic crowds. Cricket is in really good hands here." Last week, former Proteas captain and CSA Director of Cricket Graeme Smith revealed that the door is still open for De Villiers to play his way into the Proteas team for this year's T20 World Cup. "I think it is great that AB has expressed his desire to be back in the system. Those chats aren't formal but we are looking at options around the T20 World Cupâ€š" said Smith. De Villiers has stated that he would love to play in the T20 World Cup in Australia but added that his return was "not a guarantee". Meanwhile, the Proteas have just come off a 3-1 Test series loss at home against England and now prepare for three ODIs and three T20Is.
