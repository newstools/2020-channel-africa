The patients are a Burkinab√® couple who recently returned from France in February, Health Minister Claudine Lougue told reporters. The man is 73-years-old and the woman is 57. They tested positive for the virus on Monday and have been placed in isolation, authorities say. A third person who was reportedly in close contact with the couple has been placed under observation. Burkina Faso becomes the sixth sub-Saharan African country to report positive tests for coronavirus. Latest figures indicate there are now 100 confirmed coronavirus cases across Africa.
