Karius’ test, which is already being used in more than 100 United States hospitals, turns liquid biopsy technology previously used chiefly to measure the progress of cancers to the detection of over 1000 pathogens, including bacteria and fungi. The funding round values the company at over $700 million, according to a filing made by the company to the state of Delaware, a copy of which was seen by Reuters. Karius said it was not disclosing valuation details at this time. Dr. Bill Muller at Lurie Children’s Hospital in Chicago said his hospital typically uses the test on patients who are at the most risk of infections that are difficult to diagnose using conventional methods. He estimates that his hospital typically averages five-10 orders of the test per month. The company said the list price for the test was $2000 for hospitals. The deal is relatively small by the standards of Softbank and its giant investment arm, but adds to a growing list of healthcare investments that include drugmaker Roivant Sciences and Vir Biotechnology Inc, an infectious-disease focused drug developer that made its public debut in 2019.
