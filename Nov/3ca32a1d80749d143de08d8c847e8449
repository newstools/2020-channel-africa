The country has also recorded 38 new COVID-19 related fatalities. This brings the total deaths to 21 477 deaths. In a statement, Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize says the most deaths were recorded in the Eastern Cape. “Eastern Cape 17, Gauteng one, Northern Cape 7 and Western Cape 13.” Concerns have been raised over the rising number of positive COVID-19 cases in the province, particularly in the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality. The metro now accounts for 70% of confirmed cases in the Eastern Cape. Minister Mkhize returned to the province last week for a second time in two weeks to oversee efforts to curb the transmission of the virus. He visited medical facilities to assess their readiness for a spike in patients infected with COVID-19, participate in community awareness programmes, and meet with key stakeholders in the province. He has said he will make recommendations on his findings to Cabinet. Motherwell, one of the biggest townships in the metro, is amongst the hotspots, as well as Zwide, Algoa Park, and Cleary Park. --SABC--
