Dye Designs announced his death on Twitter without mention of a cause of death. The PGA Tour and PGA of America were among those hailing the work of Dye, who designed more than 100 courses. "Pete's influence is far-reaching, leaving a global imprint on both the amateur and professional games," US PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan said in a statement. PGA of America President, Suzy Whaley, said Dye "left an imprint on the world of golf that will be experienced for generations, painting wonderful pictures with the land that continue to inspire, entertain and challenge us."

--News24-- Golf world lost a great friend today in Pete Dye. First met Pete when I was 16 years old. Pete was 30 and we played an exhibition with Sam Snead in Urbana, Ohio. We became friends; we played a lot of golf together; and we designed courses together...ð·Jim Mandeville @NicklausCo pic.twitter.com/XnZphNWfi7
