This has made it difficult for motorists to access fuel which has been sold in foreign currency for anything between $1.25 per litre and $1.50. A litre of petrol fetches $2 on the black market. Statutory Instrument 212 of 2019 allows guests of the State only to buy petrol, diesel or other petroleum products in foreign currency, but only at designated outlets. Last Friday, Energy and Power Development Deputy Minister, Magna Mudyiwa, said the sale of fuel in foreign currency was unlawful. It is only those few designated service stations that can sell in foreign currency. They exclusively sell to diplomats and guests of the State,” she said. “All other service stations doing that are violating the law and we shall, through the Zimbabwe Energy Regulatory Authority (ZERA), enhance our surveillance system. “It has to be clear to every trade, service stations included, that the Zimbabwe dollar is the only legal tender applicable in our economy except those who fall in the category I have made reference to.” The sale of fuel in foreign currency has drawn mixed feelings from consumers with some complaining that they were being ripped off, while those with access to foreign currency viewed it as a better option. A survey carried by The Herald showed that some filling stations, particularly those in outlying areas of the central business district (CBD) were selling fuel in foreign currency. Last year, the Government liberalised the importation of fuel and gave companies with free funds permission to import fuel for their own use. The move was expected to augment supply gaps in the market. The envisaged beneficiaries of that policy were mining companies and those in the farming sector. Mudyiwa said the Government, through the central bank, was finalising the renewal of letters of credit. --Herald--
