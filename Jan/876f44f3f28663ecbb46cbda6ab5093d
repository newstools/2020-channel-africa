US President, Donald Trump, on Tuesday proposed creating a Palestinian state as part of a Middle East peace plan, drawing Palestinian condemnation for imposing strict conditions and agreeing to let Israel maintain control of long-contested WestBank settlements. "France welcomes Trump's efforts and will study closely the peace programme he has presented," said a statement from the French Foreign Ministry, which also reiterated Franceâ€™s desire for a two-state solution on Israel and Palestine.
