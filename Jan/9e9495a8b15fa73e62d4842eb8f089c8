Retired General, Leopoldino Fragoso do Nascimento, known as General Dino, holds a 15% stake in Puma via his company Cochan Holdings. Trafigura holds 49% and Angola’s state firm Sonangol 28%. Puma’s shareholding structure was put together under Trafigura’s former Chief Executive Officer and founder Claude Dauphin, who was close to the former ruling Angolan elite. However, the Swiss firm’s hopes of listing Puma hit compliance hurdles owing to the general’s presence as a significant stakeholder. --Reuters--
