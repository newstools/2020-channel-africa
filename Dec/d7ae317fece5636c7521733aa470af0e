The response comes after the UK said it would drop tariffs against the US over subsidies for aerospace firms. This was in a bid to reach a post-Brexit trade deal with Washington. In November 2020, the EU hit $4 billion of US goods with duties of up to 25% in retaliation for illegal state aid given to American aerospace giant Boeing. Earlier this week the UK government said tariffs will be suspended in the UK from 1 January, when the current post-Brexit transition period ends. But the US responded saying the UK had no right to impose the tariffs anyway. The US Trade Representative said only the EU sued the US at the WTO, while the UK "did not bring a case in its individual capacity." "Therefore, the UK has no authority from the WTO to participate in any such action after it no longer is part of the EU." --BBC--
