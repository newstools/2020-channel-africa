In a coordinated announcement, the remaining tournaments on the schedule said they will not host fans due to concerns over Covid-19. All five tournaments held since the PGA Tour returned from its coronavirus shutdown in June have taken place without spectators. Fans had initially been set to be allowed at this week's Memorial Tournament in Ohio but that plan was scrapped after a sharp escalation in coronavirus cases. Monday's announcement means there will be no spectators at the climax of the season, which concludes with the FedEx Cup Playoff series' Tour Championship, due to be held from September 4-7 in Atlanta. "These decisions are never easy," Tour Championship Executive Director, Allison Fillmore, said in a statement describing the move as the "best decision for all involved." The two other legs of the FedEx Cup playoffs, the August 20-23 Northern Trust at TPC Boston, and the BMW Championship at Olympia Fields, Illinois, will also be affected. --News24--
