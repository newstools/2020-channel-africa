The new policy is targeting fake videos created using artificial intelligence to alter an individualâ€™s appearance or speech. Doctored photos and audio will also be flagged according to a blog post by Twitter on the new policy. "You may not deceptively share synthetic or manipulated media that are likely to cause harm. In addition, we may label Tweets containing synthetic and manipulated media to help people understand their authenticity and to provide context," Twitter wrote. The firm says adjustments to the policy were informed by feedback captured in a recent survey involving more than 6 500 respondents. The respondents were drawn from civil society groups, academic experts and members of the public. The move by Twitter comes barely a month after Facebook announced that it would remove videos modified by artificial intelligence using its staff and independent fact-checkers to determine the authenticity of videos.  --BBC--
