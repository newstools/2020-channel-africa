The decision was taken to help people cope with the rainfall, Egyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly said. The downpours, which started on early Monday morning, have caused flooding on key roads and have created massive traffic jams. The Egyptian Meteorological Authority forecast that many parts of the country would continue to be hit hard by three-days of unstable weather, Xinhua added. Some also criticised the governmentâ€™s lack of preparedness as flooding cripples the capital and other major cities almost every year. In October 2019, eight people, including four children, were killed by the extreme weather conditions.
