Namuno, Chiúre and Palma districts are among the most affected according to the study published by the Observatório do Meio Rural. The study indicates that illegal and unsustainable exploitation of forest resources, itinerant agriculture and the growing demand for other non-timber forest products are the main causes of timber exploitation. The study said the authorities should enforce a proper legal system and flush out those who are not certified to work in the forests. --BBC--
