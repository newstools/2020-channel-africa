According to Tourism Recovery South Africa, more than 1 million jobs are in jeopardy in the sector and more than 600 000 people are currently facing retrenchment. Many hotels and lodges in the country are on the brink of closure. The extended lockdown, now into its fifth month, has been hard on the travel and tourism sector. The restrictions on inter-provincial travel have dented recovery plans. This has been exacerbated by the continued closure of the country’s borders as a result of the deadly coronavirus that’s already claimed more than 10 000 lives in South Africa. This means no revenue for the sector from international travellers. Hotel and lodge owners have turned to the insurance industry for some relief but they’re finding that claims they consider to be legitimate, are being declined. They say this is despite them meeting the relevant criteria for such pay-outs. William van der Riet is the owner of the Cathedral Peak Hotel, located in the KwaZulu-Natal Drakensburg Mountains. The establishment employs 200 people from surrounding rural communities who’ve been left without an income. He says without his insurance pay-out, many jobs will be lost leaving families destitute. “Insurance companies are refusing to pay even though we qualify in every aspect of the claim. 

"We should be getting relief from the insurance company. They have not come to the party, our business is now closed for over three months and there is no sign of it re-opening." --SABC--
