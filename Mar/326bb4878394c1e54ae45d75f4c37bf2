The three are at a containment facility in Yaba area as a precaution against the possible spread of the virus. Samples have been collected and the results will be released later. Nigeria confirmed its first coronavirus case in February, which was also the first case in sub-Saharan Africa. Professor Akin Abayomi, Lagos State Commissioner for Health, said one of the three is a Nigerian who returned into the city on Monday after spending seven days in France. He later developed headache and respiratory symptoms. The other cases involve travellers from England and China. --BBC--
