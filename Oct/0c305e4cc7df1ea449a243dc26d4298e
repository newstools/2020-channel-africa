In a statement, the Department of Sports, Arts and Culture says efforts have been made over several months to try and assist CSA to stabilise its governance matters. Mthethwa says the CSA has until the October 27 to make written representations before the start of government intervention. The department’s Spokesperson, Masechaba Khumalo, says: “The minister has given CSA a certain time frame to stipulate as to why he should not exercise his decision to intervene. What that intervention means will be communicated by the minister himself. Everybody should be worried. “Cricket is a loved sport and we want to get it back in play with following strict health protocols. With that said, we have to abide by the law and ensure that we prevent the spread of the coronavirus. We don’t make the laws but we have to uphold them,” adds Khumalo. Last month, Cricket South Africa‘s woes continued when Sascoc, which oversees all sport in the country, decided it was time to step in. But CSA isn’t sitting back and accepting the intervention.
