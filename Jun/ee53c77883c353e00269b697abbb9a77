Referring to an audit by the defence ministry, Maman Sayabou Issa said there had been over charging for items and military equipment that was paid for but never delivered. A preliminary audit had found more than twice as much money had been lost. A statement from the prosecutor said there was evidence of fraud, false documents and illicit enrichment. The corruption scandal caused an outcry in Niger, which has been suffering from an increase in attacks by jihadists in the south-east and west of the country. --BBC--
