Tokyo's benchmark Nikkei index nosedived more than seven percent shortly after the open, with markets around the region plummeting after a historically bad trading day in the United States (US) and Europe. The Nikkei 225 index dropped 7.12% or 1.322.15 points to 17.237.48 in early trade, while the broader Topix index fell 6.31% or 83.73 points to 1.244.15. Australia's ASX was down 7.3% and New Zealand's benchmark NZX 50 slumped 7.9%. Trading was briefly halted on South Korea's stock exchange when the benchmark KOSPI index fell 6.8%. The falls came after dramatic scenes on other global markets, with the Dow losing 10%, or around 2.350 points, to 21.200.62, in its worst session since 1987. London also had its worst day since the 1987 crash and Frankfurt its blackest day since 1989, the year the Berlin Wall fell. Paris suffered its worst one-day loss ever. Analysts said President Donald Trump's announcement of a ban on travel to the US from Europe deeply rattled investors, and measures intended to shore up business and markets were proving insufficient. "The turmoil in markets has moved up another notch over the past 24 hours with President Trump's European travel ban and underwhelming stimulatory measures adding more fuel to the fire of uncertainty, instead of providing a dose of reassurance," wrote National Australia Bank's Senior FX Strategist, Rodrigo Catril.
