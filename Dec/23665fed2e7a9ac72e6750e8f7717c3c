Ugandan police have not yet commented. Nigeria's Foreign Minister Geoffrey Onyeama yesterday tweeted that the government was engaging with the Ugandan authorities at the “highest level” to secure the release of the singers. The musicians held a concert in Uganda's capital, Kampala, on Saturday. They appeared in court on Monday on charges of "negligently doing acts likely to spread an infectious disease", and were due to appear again on Wednesday. Bebe Cool tweeted that the musicians were free, and posted a court document which ordered their release. Uganda’s state-owned New Vision newspaper has also covered the story, saying it is unclear whether charges against their manager and four others have also been dropped. --BBC--
