University officials picked up Mugaya Tungu from the police station and said the matter would be resolved internally, Tanzania Human Rights Defenders Coalition wrote in a statement. Tungu snapped the photo of his fellow students queuing up with colourful plastic buckets, and posted it online where it ended up being widely circulated. He was arrested shortly after that in his room and police did not disclose what he was being charged with. In his tweet he said it was embarrassing that 56 years after independence university students were still queuing for water delivered by bowsers.
