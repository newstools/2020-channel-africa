The plane was carrying 58 South African National Defence Force (SANDF) peacekeepers and eight air crew. It crash-landed at Goma in the eastern DRC. However, itâ€™s emerged that one soldier suffered a heart attack during the landing. The soldier is being treated in a local hospital and is recovering well. The SANDF has opened an urgent inquiry into the crash landing. SANDF Spokesperson, Siphiwe Dlamini, says:"We are relieved that there have been no casualties and no injuries. A quick urgent board of inquiry to investigate the circumstances surrounding the incident is presently being constituted by the Air Force. "There are strict regulations as to when, who speaks on what and until the investigation is completed. We will only know then what actually happened."
