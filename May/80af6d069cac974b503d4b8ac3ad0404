The government has decided to reduce the budget by "50%" for this year, President Abdelmadjid Tebboune's office said in a statement. Despite this huge reduction, the government also agreed at a cabinet meeting to increase the minimum wage from $140 (18 000 dinars) per month to $156 (20 000 dinars) while income tax will be abolished for those earning 30 000 dinars or less, the statement said. The government also postponed from Sunday until Â May 10 consideration of a finance law, which seeks to frame a response to the coronavirus pandemic.

A collapse in hydrocarbon prices this year - caused by plunging demand due to societal lockdowns designed to combat the spread of the virus and exacerbated by a brief price war between key players Russia and Saudi Arabia - is putting ever greater pressure on Algeria's external accounts. Even before this year's crisis took hold, Algeria's foreign exchange reserves had fallen to $62 billion at the end of 2019, from $180 billion in 2014. The draft law factors in a plunge in oil receipts this year to $20.6 billion, compared to the $37.4 billion previously anticipated. Tebboune on Friday ruled out approaching the IMF for a bailout, contending that "accumulating debt harms national sovereignty" when it is owed to foreign institutions. He said he preferred to rely instead on domestic borrowing.
