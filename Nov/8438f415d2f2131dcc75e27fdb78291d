Newcastle boss Steve Bruce had said on the eve of Friday’s 2-0 league win at Crystal Palace that three unnamed individuals at the club were self-isolating after testing positive. Sky Sports reported that two more individuals had joined that group ahead of Newcastle’s next league meeting at Aston Villa on Friday. “It’s a concern and difficult to manage. We’re trying our utmost to make sure we try and stay as safe as we can,” Sky Sports quoted Bruce as saying after the Palace match. “Of course my concern isn’t just the welfare of the players, which is vitally important, but my members of staff too. We’ll do our best but it’s difficult at the moment.” --Reuters--
