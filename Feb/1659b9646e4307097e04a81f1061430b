The 23-year-old endured a nightmarish time in the third ODI against England at the Wanderers on Sunday, traveling for figures of 0/36 from his first three overs and then being 0/52 from five. Then, out of nowhere, Ngidi burst into life and took 3/11 from his last four overs to finish with 3/63 (9) as the Proteas went down by two wickets. It was a similar story in the first T20 against England in East London on Wednesday night. Defending 177, the Proteas looked dead and buried. Ngidi again had been poor, sitting with figures of 0/20 (2). He then led a superb fightback along with Beuran Hendricks (2/33 in 3) to guide South Africa to the unlikeliest one-run victory and a 1-0 series lead. Ngidi finished with figures of 3/30 (4), meaning is last two overs had gone for just 10 runs and three wickets. It was another stunning display at the back-end of an innings from a man who has struggled to stay fit ever since he broke onto the international stage in 2017. Not at the speeds he once was, Ngidi is relying more on skill, especially at the death where slower balls and cutters have been a common feature of his game.
