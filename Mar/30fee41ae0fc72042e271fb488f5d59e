The al-Qaeda-linked Jamaat Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM) has, however, said it will only take part in negotiations if French troops leave the country. Last month Mali's President, Ibrahim Boubacar Ke√Øta announced talks with JNIM leaders Iyad Ag Ghali and Amadou Koufa. Local rights groups and media welcomed the development. This development comes at a time when JNIM appears to be losing ground to the so-called Islamic State (IS) group, with local media reports indicating that JNIM fighters have been defecting to IS. --BBC--
