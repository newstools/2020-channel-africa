The agency reports that an opposition figure Nouhoun Sarr said they had "decided to observe a truce on the subject of civil disobedience". Eid ul-Adha will be marked at the end of the month. "This is to allow Malians to properly prepare for and celebrate Eid. During this period, there will be no more demonstrations. And as you also know, we are preparing to host the heads of state," the agency quotes Sarr as saying. Three West African heads of state are meeting in Mali to mediate on the country's political crisis. The opposition wants President Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta to resign saying he has failed to address jihadist violence, corruption and Mali's economic challenges. The government offered to form a unity government and dissolve the country’s constitutional court but the opposition has rejected the offers. --BBC--
