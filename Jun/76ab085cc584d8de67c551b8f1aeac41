Local residents said three hours of heavy rain on Thursday caused waters to surge by one and half metres in the space of 30 minutes, forcing some to take refuge on the roofs of buildings. The Ivorian fire service is helping with the rescue and clean-up operation. Last week, 16 people in the city died after heavy rains prompted mudslides. Floods and landslides are common during Abidjan's rainy season, which begins in May and usually lasts until the end of July. --BBC--
