Like other large food companies such as Unilever, Nestle has been working hard to streamline its diverse portfolio in keeping with changing consumer tastes and growing demand for healthier and more environmentally friendly produce. “(We see a) continued increase in organic sales growth (in 2020), expecting further acceleration in 2021/2022 toward sustainable mid single-digit growth,” Nestle said in a statement on Thursday, adding it was too early to quantify the financial impact of the coronavirus outbreak. The maker of KitKat chocolate bars and Nescafe instant coffee reported full-year net profit up 24% to $12.89 billion.

Organic sales growth accelerated to 3.5% from 3% in 2018, and just below a 3.6% estimate in the company poll. It slowed to 3.0% in the final quarter of 2019, from 3.7% in the third quarter.

Rival Unilever reported underlying sales growth of 1.5% in the final quarter of 2019, the slowest in a decade. Danone reports results on February 26.
