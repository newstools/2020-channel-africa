Speaking at the launch of Ferrari's SF1000, team principal Binotto told the media that Sebastian Vettel would no longer be the team's priority driver. He explained: "They will be on the same level, they can both fight to be ahead. So let them race." However, less than two weeks later he now says the team mates won't always be free to race with Ferrari set to issue team orders if that's what the pit wall feels is best in the situation. "Binotto told Crash.net: "I am not saying that they are free to race with no team orders, so there might be team orders for the benefit of the entire team. But it has to be a clear situation. I think he (Leclerc) has already proven to be ready. "I think he did a fantastic and great season last year and he has reached the same level of Sebastian as well in terms of final results. I think he has proven he can do it. "It is right that they are on the same level to start in 2020 and I think they know as well the team has the first priority so team orders may still be there."
