The hosts are looking to avenge a 2-1 defeat on home soil two years ago, when they were missing Steve Smith and David Warner after the ball-tampering affair. Both sides are without some key players because of injury. Before the day-night Test, Kohli said: "It is definitely going to be as competitive as it has always been." Warner misses the first Test with an adductor injury, while India are awaiting the arrival of batsman Rohit Sharma. Fast bowler Ishant Sharma has been ruled out of the whole tour. India's win two years ago, their first series success in Australia, was occasionally a bad-tempered contest. "It's going to be high-voltage cricket because we have quality players on both sides and they are all hungry and eager to perform," added Kohli, who will only play in the first Test before returning home for the birth of his first child. "There's going to be tension, there's going to be stress, there's going to be emotions flaring every now and then, but I don't foresee anything getting personal anymore." India are currently top of the International Cricket Council Test Championship, with Australia second. Both sides can make big progress towards securing their place in the final, which is in England next summer. In the limited-overs matches before the Tests, Australia won the one-day series 2-1, while India took the T20s by the same scoreline. --BBC--
