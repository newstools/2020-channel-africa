The Geneva-based de Grisogono, whose main shareholders are Dos Santo's husband, Sindika Dokolo and Sodiam, the trading arm of Angola’s State-controlled diamond agency, said that it had failed to get a new owner after months of looking. “Without the financial support of the current shareholders, and without a buyer, the company’s solvency is now in question,” the company said in a statement. De Grisogono was known for hosting famous parties at the Cannes Film Festival. In revelations made in leaked documents made public on January 19, 2020, Dokolo signed a one-sided agreement in 2012 with Sodiam. They were supposed to be 50-50 partners in a deal to buy a stake in de Grisogono. The documents show that 18 months after the deal, Sodiam had put $79 million into the partnership, while Dokolo had only invested $4 million. Sodiam also awarded him a $5 million success fee for brokering the deal, so he didn't have to use any of his own money. The Angolan government says the diamonds were sold at a knockdown price and sources have told the BBC that almost $1 billion may have been lost. Dos Santos told the BBC she couldn't comment because she was not a shareholder of de Grisogono. But the leaked documents show that she is described as a shareholder of de Grisogono by her own financial advisers. --BBC--
