While tavern owners acknowledge that these will impact their income during the festive season, they believe reducing the coronavirus infection rate is more important. The Nelson Mandela Bay and Sarah Baartman regions have recorded the highest infection cases over the past month. The government is set to announce adjusted regulations for hot spots. Zonwabele Solwandle, a tavern owner at New Brighton in Port Elizabeth, says, “It will affect us financially. But what is more important more than anything is to save lives. People are dying in big numbers every day. I support the proposals.” Metro residents also welcomed the adjusted regulations. “I think the restrictions will definitely assist because New Brighton, especially the place where I am at the moment, it is one of the hotspots. So, imposing higher restrictions, numbers will decrease, flattening the curve. One cannot have such places closing. Families are dependent on the monies that are made here.” South Africa’s COVID-19 infections have increased to 796 472 with 4 173 new cases identified in the last 24 hours 65 more COVID-19 related deaths have also been reported, taking the country’s death toll to 21 709. --SABC--
