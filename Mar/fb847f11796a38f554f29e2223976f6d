The new cases are in the provinces of Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal and Western Cape and involve people who have recently returned from trips to Europe, News24 reports. â€œThose who are symptomatic have started receiving treatment. Some of these patients are already in hospital while some, specifically those who are asymptomatic, are in self-quarantine. Contact tracing has also started for all these cases," Health Minister Zweli Mkhize is quoted as saying.
