Crowds of predominantly young people had set up roadblocks in the southeastern town of Bonoua, near the main city of Abidjan, in protest at President Alassane Outtara's decision to stand for a third term at the end of October, which critics say violates the country's constitution. More than 12 people have died since August in clashes related to the election. Outtara's two main challengers, former President Henri Konan Bedie and former Prime Minister Pascal Affi N'Guessan, say they will boycott the poll, and have called on their supporters to prevent it going ahead. --BBC--
