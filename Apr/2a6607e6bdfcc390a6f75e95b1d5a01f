The first round of the much-delayed vote took place three weeks ago despite jihadist attacks and intimidation - including the kidnapping of opposition leader Soumaila Cissé. Voting is taking place in spite of the coronavirus pandemic - a threat that Mali's poor healthcare facilities are ill-equipped to meet. "The safety and sanitary measures we wanted to put in place are in place. Obviously we will be very vigilant throughout the day to ensure that the distancing measures are respected,” the prime minister said after casting his vote on Sunday. The West African nation has recorded 216 cases of Covid-19, including 13 deaths. The elections were supposed to have taken place in 2018, but have been put off a number of times, mainly because of insecurity. The army has been battling militants in the north since 2012. It is hoped newly elected MPs will endorse changes to the constitution that might ease political tensions. --BBC-
