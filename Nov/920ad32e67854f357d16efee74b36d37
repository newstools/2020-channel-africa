Santam said it believed the court erred in its judgment on the causation, insured peril, the trends clause and the indemnity period. The insurer said it was therefore important to take the matter to the Supreme Court of Appeal. It said the significance of the CBI matter to the insurance industry and the precedents at stake necessitate continuing to the next stage in the process of obtaining legal finality. “Our reinsurers are key stakeholders in the insurance value chain as they are in effect insurers to the insurer,” Santam said. “They agree with us on the need to obtain legal certainty from a higher court.” The court found in favour of Ma-Afrika, stating that Santam was liable to pay the full business interruption losses including the impact of the government’s response to Covid-19. The judgment ordered the insurer to pay Ma-Afrika for the impact over the entire policy period of 18 months without limitations. The court also ordered that Santam pay Ma-Afrika’s legal costs. Absa Asset Management investment analyst and associate portfolio manager Cornette van Zyl said the ruling was complex. Van Zyl said would be difficult to quantify the exact impact on the short-term insurance industry in South Africa. --IOL--
