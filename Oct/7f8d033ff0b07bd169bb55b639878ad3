Authorities have complained of poor social distancing, and Deputy Health Minister Iraj Harirchi said the pandemic could cause 600 daily deaths in coming weeks if Iranians failed to respect health protocols in the Middle East’s hardest-affected country. A caption that ran on state television news said an Iranian died of novel coronavirus every five minutes, a rate that corresponds to daily death tallies reported by the authorities of just above or below 300 over the past 20 days. Health Ministry spokesperson Sima Sadat Lari told state Television on Sunday that 32 616 people had died of the disease and the number of confirmed cases had reached 568 896. Some experts have doubted the accuracy of Iran’s official coronavirus tolls. A report by the Iranian parliament’s research centre in April 2020 suggested that the coronavirus tolls might be almost twice as many as those announced by the health ministry. The report said that Iran’s official coronavirus figures were based only on the number of deaths in hospitals and those who had already tested positive for the coronavirus. --Reuters--
