The oil giant said that because of this it would revise down the value of its assets by as much as $17.5 billion. It expects the price of Brent crude to average $55 a barrel. As a result, BP said it would have to become a "leaner, faster-moving and lower cost organisation." Last week, the firm announced plans to cut 10 000 jobs following a global slump in demand for oil. Countries across the globe have ordered people to stay indoors and not travel as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, which has caused a slump in demand for oil. As a result, the cost of oil fell to less than $20 a barrel at the peak of the crisis, less than a third of the $66 it cost at the start of the year. For a brief period buyers were actually paid to take delivery of crude oil amid a shortage of storage. The price has since partly recovered to around $37 a barrel. BP says it has "a growing expectation that the aftermath of the pandemic will accelerate the pace of transition to a lower carbon economy and energy system, as countries seek to 'build back better' so that their economies will be more resilient in the future". --BBC--
