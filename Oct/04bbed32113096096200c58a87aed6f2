Malindi MP Aisha Jumwa was arraigned before a court in the coastal city of Mombasa. Prosecution said it had enough evidence to charge her for the killing of one Ngumbao Jola in 2019. Jola was shot during a scuffle in ward by-election campaigns in Aisha Jumwa’s Malindi constituency. It was then reported that Jumwa had stormed the home of a political opponent to confront opposing supporters when the incident occurred. If declared fit to stand trial, she will take plea on Thursday along with her bodyguard. Ahead of the trial critics have accused the state of harassing Jumwa because of her political stand. The MP has declared her support for Deputy President William Ruto’s presidential ambitions. She is facing separate corruption charges over alleged embezzlement of nearly $20 000 of Constituency Development Funds. The public prosecutor maintains the decision to press charges is based on evidence collected, which it says is enough for a murder charge. Several politicians are either under investigation or on trial for corruption and other felonies. In June, MP John Waluke was sentenced to 67 years in jail for corruption, or to pay a $7 million fine. After nearly four months behind bars, he was granted bail pending an appeal on the sentence. --BBC--
