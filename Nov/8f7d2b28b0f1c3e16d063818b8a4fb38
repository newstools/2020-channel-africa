They are due to begin their limited-overs series against England in Cape Town on Friday November 27. The unnamed player has been moved to separate accommodation and is isolating away from the team. On Wednesday three South Africa players were put in isolation following the previous positive Covid test. "Team management and Cricket South Africa (CSA) are in close communication with their counterparts from the England Cricket Board to ensure full transparency and the most responsible plan of action going forward," said CSA in a statement on Friday. England will play three Twenty20s and three one-day internationals, all behind closed doors.
