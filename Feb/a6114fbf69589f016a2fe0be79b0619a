The virus has killed 2.442 and infected 76.936 people in China, and slammed the brakes on the worldâ€™s second-largest economy. International worries about the spread of coronavirus outside China grew, with the World Health Organization (WHO) expressing concern about the number of cases with no clear epidemiological link. Outside China, there have been more than 1 400 cases in 28 countries, the WHO said on Saturday. That includes one confirmed case on the African continent, in Egypt. Italy is battling the largest flare-up of the disease yet seen in Europe, with three people dying of the illness since Friday and more than 150 cases reported. Almost a dozen towns in Lombardy and Veneto with a combined population of some 50 000 have effectively been placed under quarantine as authorities struggled to find out how the outbreak started.
