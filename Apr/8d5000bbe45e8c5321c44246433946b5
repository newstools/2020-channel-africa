Markets were encouraged by guidelines from the Trump administration for “re-opening the economy” that leaves the timeline in the hands of state and local governments. 

The South African unit traded weaker during a choppy European session as the scars of an abysmal week remained visible on the battered currency. 

At the close of local trade, the rand quoted 1.16% weaker at R18.88/$, after trading in range of R18.61/$ - R18.92/$. 

The rand begins the week trading slightly firmer, but the economic damage caused by the Covid-19 pandemic has left the local unit vulnerable and a further depreciation this week seems likely. 

Expected range today R18.60/$ - R19.00/$.
