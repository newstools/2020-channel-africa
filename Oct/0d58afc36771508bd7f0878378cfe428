The 46-year-old's father, ex-rugby league player Danny Wilson, is black and his mother, Lynne Giggs, is white. Cardiff-born Giggs has spoken before about the "shock" of facing racism for the first time when his family moved to Manchester when he was seven. "I didn't experience anything in Cardiff," Giggs told ITV Wales. "I was seven, so I can't remember a lot before that. It wasn't until I moved to Manchester. "Where I lived my dad was very well known, because he was such a good player. He was probably the best player in the team in that town. "As you can guess, to look at me, you wouldn't think my dad was black. "But obviously everyone knowing that was my dad, and my dad quite clearly being black, that's really when I sort of experienced the first time. Which was a bit weird, because I'd never experienced that before."
