The funds are meant to help vulnerable firms and to fast-track funding to companies that are critical in efforts to address the impact of the coronavirus, Patel said. The minister was on Tuesday speaking at a briefing in Pretoria with ministers in the economic cluster. They laid out their action plans to mitigate the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak on the economy. This followed an announcement by South African President Cyril Ramaphosa on Monday that there would be a nationwide lockdown of 21 days, enforced from Thursday at midnight. The President also announced that tax subsidies and financial support would be provided for small businesses and individuals during the crisis.

Patel weighed in on the funding from the Industrial Development Corporation (IDC), which will support South African businesses. 

Apart from the $29 million set aside for essential medical products, $39 million will be made available for working capital, equipment and machinery. The funds will also be used to prioritise food security, by addressing surges in demand and to support supply chains that may be interrupted by the closure of large companies.
