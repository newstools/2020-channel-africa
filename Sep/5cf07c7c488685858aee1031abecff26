It says it would make the Medium Term spending process more complicated by forcing some government departments to make large cuts in their expenditure on important things like infrastructure. The report also says that funding the struggling airline would send a worrying signal to investors, including the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. SAA needs $63 billion to re-start and will need more funding for recapitalisation by the beginning of 2021. Government had until last week to announce where the funding would come from but missed the deadline. However, it says it is still firmly committed to funding the state carrier. Intellidex analyst Peter Attard Montalto says, “Government could well fund the money for SAA and the cabinet meeting is expected to authorise the $63 billion. 

However, we think there are better things to spend the money on like infrastructure which will be cut.” “Jobs plan that the President (Cyril Ramaphosa) is pushing might also be cut and the education and healthcare. So ultimately it is not going to be about finding the money per se but the negative impact of having to find that money to fund SAA,” explains  Attard Montalto.
