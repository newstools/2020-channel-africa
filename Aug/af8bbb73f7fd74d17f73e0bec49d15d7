Rights groups say the number of deaths is significantly higher, with killings reported in more than a dozen locations in the Oromia region. The protests erupted on Tuesday following a social media campaign calling for the release of opposition politicians Jawar Mohammed and Bekele Gerba. They were detained after the shooting dead in June of popular Oromo singer Hachalu Hundessa. --BBC--
