BBC reported earlier that the authorities had said the border had closed for most people following riots. Matsinhe said this wasn't the case but did say there had been riots. He urged Mozambicans not to cross the border as South African protesters had put up barricades about 10km Â inside the country so the traffic can't move either way. The demonstrators were angry about a wave of car thefts, saying that the stolen vehicles were being driven into Mozambique, reports the newspaper, O Pais.
