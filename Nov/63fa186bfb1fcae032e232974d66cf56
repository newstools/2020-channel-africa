The NUP presidential candidate Robert Kyagulanyi popularly known as Bobi Wine is expected to lead the event in the western city of Mbarara on Saturday. Local police boss Abas Byakagaba said on Friday that his forces would not standby to see NUP members "disregard the standard operating procedures." He said that political campaigns and rallies remain banned in the country. Bobi Wine had a run in with the police on Tuesday as he presented his nomination papers for the election. Dozens of his supporters who had escorted him were arrested and other injured after police fired tear gas to disperse them. Uganda will hold elections in January next year. --BBC--
