The violent protests have been going on weeks since the ruling party nominated President Alassane Ouattara to seek re-election for a third term. The directorate of police announced on Facebook that the suspect was arrested after members of the public reported him. He was found with a can of diesel and admitted to setting several vehicles on fire with four of his friends, according to a police note published by Fraternit√© Matin newspaper. President Ouattara had ruled out re-election but reconsidered after his preferred successor Prime Minister Amadou Gon Coulibaly, who had been nominated by the ruling party, died unexpectedly of heart attack last month. --BBC--
