While the South African government has special packages to help its own citizens who have lost their incomes through the lockdown, many migrant workers do not qualify because they do not have the necessary immigration status. The Zimbabwe Government through its embassy in Pretoria is battling to help its nationals. So far, over 1 200 people have been repatriated via Beitbridge Border Post after the embassy managed to arrange buses and negotiated with the South African authorities for the necessary travel permits to move during the lockdown. Others are still registering with the embassy for various needs. It is however, not clear how many Zimbabweans are based in South Africa, though 300 000 are there courtesy of the three-year Zimbabwe Exemption permits which expire next year. Thousands others are there under less formal arrangements, either as visitors while indulging in cross-border trade or are in the informal sector. Zimbabwean Ambassador to South Africa David Hamadziripi said as of May 6, 2 680 Zimbabweans had registered for repatriation while 4 172 had indicated they were in need of food. --Herald--
