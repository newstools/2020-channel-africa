He said this on Saturday as healthcare workers in the hard-hit region said they did not have enough masks and medical equipment. With the number of known cases soaring past 115 000, the highest tally in the world, Trump said he might impose a quarantine on New York, New Jersey and parts of Connecticut to protect other states that have yet to bear the brunt. “They’re having problems down in Florida. A lot of New Yorkers are going down. We don’t want that,” Trump told reporters. Since the virus first appeared in the US in late January, Trump has vacillated between playing down the risks of infection and urging Americans to take steps to slow its spread. He also appeared to soften his previous comments calling for the US economy to be reopened by mid-April. “We’ll see what happens,” he said. It was not clear whether Trump would be able to block road, air and sea travel out of a region that serves as the economic engine of the eastern US, accounting for 10% of the population and 12% of Gross Domestic Product. --Reuters--
