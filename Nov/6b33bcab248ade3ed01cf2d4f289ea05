The floodgate was opened in late September, leading to increased water flow downstream the Zambezi river that has now submerged several islands in Mutarara district. The current rainy season has significantly increased water levels on the reservoir behind the dam. Officials opened the floodgate to relieve pressure on the dam. The meteorological department has warned that Tete province is likely to experience above normal levels of rain in the months of November and December. With a tropical climate and a rainy season that runs between October and March, Mozambique is prone to natural disasters, including drought, flooding, lightening and cyclones. --BBC--
