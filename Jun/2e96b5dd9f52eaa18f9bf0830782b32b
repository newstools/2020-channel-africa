Now in his late 70s, Habré was jailed in 2016 for abuses committed when he was in power. At least 40,000 people are estimated to have been killed under his rule in the 1980s. Some of his victims have welcomed the news that he would be returning to prison. One them, Abdourahmane Guèye, told news site L'Actu Acho that Habré hadn't cared when inmates died in his cells having been "starved, tortured [and] humiliated". --bbc--
