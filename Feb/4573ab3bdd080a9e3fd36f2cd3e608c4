The suspected cases involve two men, a Chinese national and an Argentinian national, who live together, but travelled on different dates from China. They reported themselves to the emergency unit of Korle Bu Teaching Hospital on Wednesday after being turned away from an unnamed private-owned clinic. They complained of malaise, muscle pains and flu symptoms. Officials say the Argentinian man arrived in Accra from China's Shanghai city last month, while the Chinese national arrived in the country around September 2019. The Secretary of the Ghana Medical Association in Accra, Dr William Baah said both patients have been quarantined as their blood samples are being analysed. "They’ve all developed some symptoms that fits the case definition but it doesn’t mean they have coronavirus though," Dr Baah said. Health officials say further samples will be taken on Thursday for testing at the Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research. --BBC--
