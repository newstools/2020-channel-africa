Cricket Australia announced the round of cuts on Wednesday, a day after chief executive Kevin Roberts resigned, with the former England batsman one of those let go. Langer said it was "really hard" breaking the news to Hick - as tough as facing the legendary West Indian pace duo. "You won't meet a person of greater integrity than Graeme Hick. His worth ethic is unbelievable, his knowledge of the game is unbelievable, so it was a really tough call," he said. "It's nothing that he's done, it's more of an impact of the cost-cutting that we're doing because of the Covid-19 situation." Some 15% of Cricket Australia's staff are being made redundant to save $27.6 million, with the governing body concerned about further financial shocks in 2020. Langer said the cuts would have an impact on the national team. Along with losing Hick, he said it may not be possible to have a second selector travel on overseas tours, as is customary. Langer, Trevor Hohns and George Bailey make up the three-man selection panel. "I think there'll be more in-depth conversations to work through actually how this is going to work," he said. --News24--
