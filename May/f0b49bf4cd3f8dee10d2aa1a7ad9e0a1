There have been attacks in various parts of the country ahead of presidential and parliamentary elections due to be held in two weeks. At least two people have been killed in recent days. Human Rights Watch says there has been a systematic campaign of repression against Burundi's media and opposition. Other countries in the region have imposed restrictions on movement because of the coronavirus, but large political rallies are taking place across Burundi. --BBC--
