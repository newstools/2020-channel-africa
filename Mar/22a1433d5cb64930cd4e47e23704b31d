She transited through Sweden and Denmark. Health Minister, Ummy Mwalimu, said the patient didn’t show any symptoms when she was temperature-screened at the airport. But when she was at the airport she started feeling unwell and that’s when she went to hospital. Mwalimu said the patient is being closely monitored at a hospital in Arusha city in northern Tanzania. She said she spoke to the patient, who sounded as though she was stable. The minister said health officials were now attempting to trace all individuals who came into contact with her. Mwalimu insisted that the country is well prepared to respond to the outbreak and that officials are working closely with the World Health Organisation in efforts to contain the outbreak. --BBC--
