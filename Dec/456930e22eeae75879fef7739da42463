Initial results suggest the incumbent Nana Akufo-Addo is ahead of his rival, the former president, John Mahama. The ruling National Patriotic Party (NPP) is also reported to be leading in the parliamentary polls but Mr Mahama's National Democratic Congress (NDC) disputes this. The election on Monday passed off largely peacefully, but local media in the central region say a group opened fire at one polling station, injuring two people. Eleven candidates are in the race to unseat President Nana Akufo-Addo, who is running for his second term. His main challenger is his predecessor and 2016 opponent, John Dramani Mahama. Youth unemployment, security concerns and effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on the economy were among the top issues Ghanaians were considering when voting.
