The 30th seed displayed her trademark court craft to undermine Sabalenka’s raw power as she surpassed her previous best third round showing at Roland Garros in 2017. “She’s such an aggressive player. But then I had to still do a lot of slices, drop shots, mix it up. I knew that could bother her a lot. I’m so happy that my game really worked today,” Jabeur, who won the Roland Garros junior title in 2011, said. Sabalenka saved three set points at 5-6 in the first set, then led 5-1 in tiebreak, but a series of unforced errors allowed 26-year-old Jabeur to snatch it. Jabeur’s level dipped in the face of some fierce Sabalenka hitting as the second set slipped away in little over 20 minutes. But the Tunisian, who became the first Arab woman to reach a Grand Slam quarter-final in Australia this year, re-grouped and forged 3-0 ahead in the deciding set. She also had points for a 4-0 lead, but Belarusian Sabalenka upped her intensity and the decibels to keep herself in contention. --Reuters--
