The guards shot down the drone when it flew over the home of the Sovereign Council President  Lieutenant Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, al-Sahya adds.

A source told al-Sayha that the drone belonged to the security forces and was on a mission to monitor the night curfew and had strayed off course. The curfew was imposed on Monday March 23.

Sudan’s Health Ministry on Saturday announced two new COVID-19 cases, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in the country to five. The two new patients are Sudanese citizens who returned from foreign countries last week, the report said.

The Sudanese Health Ministry urged the citizens to follow all medical instructions and advice such as stopping gatherings and take necessary measures to protect themselves and their families.
