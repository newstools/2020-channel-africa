"The prosecutor general has been politicised, he is exploiting his authority," a member of Bashir's defence team is quoted by AFP as saying. The defence allege bias on Al-Hebr's part because he had filed the charges against Bashir before taking up the post of prosecutor general, reports AFP. The judge adjourned the trial until 10 November. Bashir's trial opened on July 21 and is in connection with the 1989 military coup that brought him to power. He could face the death penalty if found guilty. --BBC--
