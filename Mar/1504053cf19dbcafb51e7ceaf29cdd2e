The United States (US) on Thursday surpassed China as the country with the most number of coronavirus cases and is expected to become the epicenter of the outbreak. “We’re not out of the woods yet on the health or economic crisis,” said Eddie Perkin, chief equity investment officer at Eaton Vance in Boston. “It would seem odd to me if the markets fully stabilize before we get more clarity on the health front.” Unprecedented stimulus measures by the Federal Reserve and the White House have set the S&P 500 .SPX for its best week in over a decade, but it is still down 14% in March and on course for its worst month since the height of the financial crisis. The Dow Jones .DJI, briefly establishing a bull market with its gains on Thursday, is on course for its biggest weekly gain since 1938, largely helped by a stunning four-day rally for Boeing Co (BA.N). But with growing fears of a deep global recession, traders expect more wild swings in financial markets until there are signs of new virus cases peaking and sweeping restrictions placed on entire countries being lifted. A record three million surge in US weekly jobless claims offered the first glimpse of the extent of the economic hit from the outbreak, which has forced several companies to shutter operations and announce layoffs. “Big questions are starting to be answered, like how bad is the spread of infections (and) how bad is the economic damage,” said Neil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets.com in London.
