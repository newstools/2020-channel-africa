In Africa, total exports of clothing and textile in 2019 were $18.3 billion, according to Trade Map, dominated by Tunisia $4.3 billion, Morocco $4 billion, Egypt $3.2 billion, South Africa $1.5 billion and Mauritius $687 million. ZimTrade said the country has huge potential in clothing and textile exportation. For Zimbabwe, the total value in export of clothing and textile in 2019 was just $62.3 million and concentrated within the regional markets such as South Africa, Mozambique, Zambia, Malawi, and Botswana, according to Trade Map. “Of this value, exports of cotton amounted to around $42 million, whilst articles of apparel and clothing accessories, which are not knitted or crocheted were $12 million,” it said. ZimTrade said although the nature of export markets is not a challenge, the export figures shows that more needs to be done if the fashion industry is to contribute meaningfully to economic development and national exports. It said figures from Trade Map suggest that the country is exporting more clothing and textile products that are not value added, which translate to exporting jobs. --Herald--
