The pair was at the centre of controversy last month as South Africa Rugby gave their players an option to look for contracts abroad having enforced a salary cut of up to 43% due to the coronavirus pandemic. Marx has chosen to sign for the Kubota Spears in Japan rather than renew his deal to keep him at Johannesburg's franchise the Lions. Du Toit, meanwhile, has agreed to remain with the Stormers despite having generated interest from several European clubs. Habana, who left the Bulls for the Stormers in 2009 before five seasons with Toulon, sympathised with both of them. "It's difficult for any player to be in a position like that. First and foremost you're going to be judged on whatever decision you make," Habana said. "Not many top-class players actually made the decision to go overseas and Pieter-Steph's name got thrown around quite a bit and you hope at some point he will be able to maximise on the opportunities both financially and commercially. "I think he's a quality enough player to get some great value out of his rugby playing ability in a few years with the Lions next year which will be the goalpost he has moved towards in making the decision on where to go." --Sport24--
