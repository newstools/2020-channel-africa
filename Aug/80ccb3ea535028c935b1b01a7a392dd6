Amakhosi are at the top of the Premiership standings with a four-point lead over second-placed Mamelodi Sundowns, who have a game in hand. The league is due to resume on August 11, when Sundowns face Orlando Pirates, and Chiefs will get their campaign underway again the day thereafter when they take on Bidvest Wits. Chiefs have a great opportunity to end their five-year trophy drought by claiming the league title, and Khune is determined to make the supporters proud. The rest of the PSL campaign will be completed behind closed doors, and Khune admits that will also be difficult. "You are the driving force behind this team and we will miss you cheering us up when the league restarts," Khune told Chiefs' official website. "However, we still want to make you proud and you will be that pillar of strength for us. We are at present in the number one spot and we don't want to disappoint you when we go past the finish line." --News24--
