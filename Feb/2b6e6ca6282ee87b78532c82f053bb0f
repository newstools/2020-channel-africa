The Australians took the three-match T20 series 2-1, handing South Africa two massive defeats to the in the process. The hosts had the mammoth task of chasing 194 after De Kock won the toss and elected to bowl first but were dismissed for 96 in 15.3 overs. None of the South African batsmen showed any sign of resilience with Rassie van der Dussen top scoring with 24. Australian spinner, Ashton Agar, and fast bowler Mitchell Starc, were the destroyers in chief, both taking three wickets apiece. Following the loss, De Kock was baffled by the Proteas' performance and admitted that honest conversations need to be had. "To be honest, I'm not too sure. It was just another blowout," a stunned De Kock told reporters on Wednesday. "It wasn't good enough doing it twice in one series but we've got to have a good look at ourselves and ask some honest questions. "In this series we played one decent game and then obviously the other two are just a disappointment. It's not really the way we want to go about things," said De Kock. The two teams will now turn their attention to the ODIs with the first match scheduled at Boland Park in Paarl on Saturday (13:00).
