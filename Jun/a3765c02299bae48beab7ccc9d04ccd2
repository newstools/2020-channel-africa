It is thought to contain the remains of conscripts who were killed in 1998 as they attempted to escape from El Elafon military camp to join their families for Muslim holiday Eid al-Adha. The military camp was used to train conscripts during the rule of ex-President Omar al-Bashir, who was overthrown in April 2019. Netherlands-based Radio Tamazuj reports that the conscripts were afraid of being sent to war in South Sudan. They had also been angered by a decision by the army to deny them time off with their families during the Muslim holiday. Sudan split into two countries in July 2011 after the people of the south voted for independence - but for decades a brutal civil war was fought, costing the lives of 1.5 million people. --BBC--
