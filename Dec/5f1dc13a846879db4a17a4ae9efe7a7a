The game was suspended in the first half on Tuesday after players from Paris St Germain (PSG) and Istanbul Başakşehir refused to continue playing and walked off the pitch.

Başakşehir had accused the Romanian fourth official of making a racist remark during an argument with their assistant coach, Pierre Webo.

Four new officials will adjudicate the resumed match in Paris, which is expected to be played from the exact moment it was halted.

The football authorities are investigating the racism claims.

PSG striker Kylian Mbappe and Cameroonian football legend, Roger Milla, tweeted messages of support to Webo.
