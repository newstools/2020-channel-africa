In a statement read on the state radio Wednesday morning, Burhan defended his meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu in Entebbe, Uganda, on February 3. After the meeting, Netanyahu's office said Israel and Sudan would move to normalise relations. Burhan said that the meeting was part of his responsibility to preserve Sudan’s security and “supreme interests of the Sudanese people”. He said that Sudan’s relationship with Israel was "the responsibility of the relevant institutions", in what seems to be reference to Sudan's civilian cabinet. Sudan state-owned media did not report on the meeting between Burhan and Netanyahu. The private media however covered the story. Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok has welcomed Burhan's statement and said Sudan's Foreign Affairs must be made by the council of ministers. --BBC--
