The number of daily confirmed coronavirus cases has ticked up steadily in recent weeks, with health experts warning lax adherence to hygiene and distancing rules among some of the public is spreading the virus across communities. “We are already in a second, shallow upswing,” Susanne Johna, President of Marburger Bund, which represents doctors in Germany, told the Augsburger Allgemeine newspaper. She said there was a danger that a longing to return to normality and a suppression of containment measures would fritter away the success Germany had achieved so far, urging people to stick to social distancing and hygiene rules and wear masks. Europe’s biggest economy has so far withstood the pandemic with far fewer deaths than some large neighbours like France and Italy, owing to widespread testing, a well-equipped healthcare system and good adherence to social distancing. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany increased by 879 to 211 281, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed on Tuesday. The reported death toll rose by eight to 9156, the tally showed. Johna said hospitals were prepared and would make intensive care beds available to COVID-19 patients on a staggered basis, while at the same time gradually reducing the number of planned admissions to normal wards. According to the DIVI intensive care register there are almost 21 000 intensive care beds in Germany, of which some 12 200 are currently free. As of Monday, there were 270 COVID-19 patients in intensive care, of whom 130 were being ventilated. --Reuters--
