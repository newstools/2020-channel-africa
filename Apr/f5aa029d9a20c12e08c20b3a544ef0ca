Human Rights Defenders Coalition (HRDC) say they want to shut the buildings to force Malawi's President Peter Mutharika to sack the head of the election management body, Jane Ansah. The activists have been running nationwide anti-government protests against the handling of last Mayâ€™s presidential elections. A re-vote is due to be held on 2 July after last year's vote was annulled by the constitutional court in February, citing widespread irregularities including tallying forms that were doctored with Tipp-Ex. The President is appealing against the ruling. Gift Trapence, HRDC's interim vice-chairperson, and group member Macdonald Sembereka were arrested on Thursday night. Police are now looking for Interim Chairperson Timothy Mtambo. Luke Tembo, a member of the HRDC, said his two colleagues have been charged with inciting violence.
