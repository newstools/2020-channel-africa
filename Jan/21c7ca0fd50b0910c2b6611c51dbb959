The deal with country’s petroleum regulator ANPG defines the terms for a risk-sharing contract on offshore oil block 18/15 and was signed on the sidelines of the UK-Africa Investment Summit on Monday. Outgoing BP Chief Executive Officer Bob Dudley and his successor Bernard Looney attended the ceremony along with Angola’s minister of Mineral Resources and Petroleum, Diamantino Azevedo, and other top officials. BP is already a partner in ongoing production in Block 18, called the Greater Plutonio development. Last week, Italy’s Eni, France’s Total, Equinor and BP were awarded rights to develop several offshore blocks.
