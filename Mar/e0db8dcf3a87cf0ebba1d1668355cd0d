The race was on the first world championship calendar in 1950 and has been held without fail since 1955. Formula One earlier said the May 24 race was postponed, along with Dutch and Spanish races scheduled for the same month, and pushed back a major technical rules revamp from 2021 to 2022. The Automobile Club de Monaco (ACM) said uncertainty about the teams’ participation and access, with neighbouring France and Italy in lockdown, made the situation ‘untenable’. They also called off a popular historic race, which uses the same tight and twisty fenced streets and was scheduled for earlier in May. “Under no circumstances will it be possible to organise these events later this year,” said the ACM. The cancellation will be a blow for Ferrari’s Monegasque Charles Leclerc as well as Mercedes’ six-times World Champion, Lewis Hamilton and many other drivers who live there. The announcement came as the Mediterranean principality revealed ruler Prince Albert had tested positive for the virus. The 10 teams and the sport’s top officials earlier agreed unanimously in a conference call to delay the implementation of technical changes that have been years in the planning. Financial changes to save money, including a cost cap, will go ahead, however. A joint Formula One and FIA statement highlighted the “currently volatile financial situation” and said teams will use their 2020 chassis for 2021. Ferrari Principal, Mattia Binotto had told the Formula One website that his team, who started a three-week factory shutdown on Thursday after Formula One cancelled the August break, were willing to do what was necessary. “It is certainly not the time for selfishness and tactics,” he said. The season-opening Australian race scheduled for March 15 was cancelled last week and Bahrain, Vietnam and China put on hold. --Reuters--
