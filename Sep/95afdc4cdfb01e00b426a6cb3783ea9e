Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, accused the court of "illegitimate attempts to subject Americans to its jurisdiction". The Hague-based ICC is currently investigating whether US forces committed war crimes in Afghanistan. The US has criticised the court since its foundation and is one of a dozen states which have not signed up. President, Donald Trump, issued an executive order in June allowing the US to block the assets of ICC employees. He has repeatedly attacked the body and questioned its independence. --BBC--
