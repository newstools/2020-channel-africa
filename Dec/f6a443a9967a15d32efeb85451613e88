On the second anniversary of mass killings in the Democratic Republic of Congo that left more than 500 people dead, Human Rights Watch has called on the government to ensure the perpetrators are finally brought to justice. The attacks in Yumbi in the north-west of the country were triggered by the burial of a Banunu customary chief on land claimed by the Batende community. The UN believes local leaders planned the violence which also destroyed the homes of about 1,500 Congolese families. The rights group says people there have been left traumatised and fearful that the lack of accountability could trigger more violence. --BBCâ€”
