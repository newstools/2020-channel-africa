The nurses are complaining about poor work conditions, being overworked and lacking safety equipment to protect them against coronavirus. Malawi has confirmed 17 cases of the respiratory virus. The nurses are also pushing the government to hire more health workers and increase their health insurance allowances. Access to public healthcare services in Malawi is free, it is mostly used by the majority of the country's population who are poor. At the country's main referral hospital in the capital, Lilongwe, groups of nurses have been sitting on the lawns outside the hospital playing card games. Some patients walked around the facility hoping the situation would change. In the commercial capital of Blantyre, the entrance to the main referral hospital was closed by rocks and tree branches. Thereâ€™s been no immediate reaction from government, but last week, Health Minister Jappie Mhango said several measures had been taken to deal with the strike including recruiting thousands of new hospital staff. --BBC--
