The bad loan transfer contract was signed by the BPC boards of directors and Recredit. Speaking to the press, the manager of Recredit stated that his firm will continue to deal with the credit recovery process of this portfolio, favouring recovery through extra judicial means. "We are going to negotiate amicably with these clients and whenever we are unable to recover through extra judicial means, we'll use all the resources that the law allows us to recover this credit portfolio", he said. He added that Recredit will make an effort to recover as much of the loan portfolio as possible, which was valued at 6% of the total portfolio, in the asset quality assessment process that Angolan Central Bank (BNA) carried out on commercial banks. On his turn, the Chairperson of the Board of Directors of BPC, André Lopes explained that with the giving away of part of its loan portfolio to Recredit, the conditions were created so that in the future this exercise of collecting and regularising BPC credit will be made by a private institution. André Lopes stressed that in the scope of the BPC recapitalisation and restructuring programme, a series of actions are foreseen, such as the reorganisation of the credit portfolio and other recapitalisation. Recredit has already managed to recover a debt of 1.5 billion Kwanzas ($2.5 million) in credit granted by BPC. --ANGOP--
