Health Minister Zwelini Mkhize announced on Friday that two deaths had occurred in the Western Cape province - one at a private hospital and the other at a public hospital. He also announced that the number of confirmed coronavirus cases had jumped to more than 1,000, but said the details will be given in a subsequent media briefing. The news comes as South Africa started a 21-day national lockdown on Thursday night to try and slow down the spread of the virus. --BBC--
