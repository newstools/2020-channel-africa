At a press conference on Monday, Cabo Delgado province's Armindo Ngunga said the new arrivals in Pemba had to resort to living in severely cramped conditions, making it impossible to practise social distancing. Instead, he advised people to stay outside their houses during the day because of the overcrowding and said that the government could provide people with face masks to wear on the streets. Cabo Delgado provincial capital Pemba shelters most of the people displaced by the jihadist attacks occurring since October 2017. The simmering militant Islamist rebellion erupted into open warfare earlier this year, with reports of massacres, beheadings and the brief seizure of two towns. The UN estimates that 250,000 people abandoned everything and sought refuge in safer areas from a conflict that has, so far, killed about 1,000 people. Those who have fled are badly in need of humanitarian assistance, including proper housing, food, health and clothing. The poor level of water supply to Pemba, is another challenge for combating Covid-19 - something Ngunga said the government was working on. --BBC--
