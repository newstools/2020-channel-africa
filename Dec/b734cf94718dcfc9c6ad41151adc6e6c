Maati Monjib, a university historian who writes frequent newspaper editorials, has denied the accusations. His arrest at a restaurant on Tuesday followed the jailing or detention of several other dissident journalists in recent months. The prosecutor’s office said in October 2020 it was investigating Monjib on suspicion of money laundering. Monjib has often denied wrongdoing in posts on his Facebook account and said he had been summoned several times by police to answer charges relating to alleged laundering of foreign funds. At a hearing on Tuesday, a judge ordered he be kept behind bars during the investigation, the prosecutor’s office said. “The Moroccan government appears to be banking on the world failing to notice its continued harassment of journalists over a holiday week,” said Justin Shilad from the Committee to Protect Journalists, an international rights group. The government has denied waging a campaign against free speech and has said the police and courts are implementing national laws.
