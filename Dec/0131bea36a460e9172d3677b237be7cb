President Alassane Ouattara was re-elected in October for a controversial third term, sparking political violence. He is scheduled to be sworn in later this week. The opposition leader said the proposed talks must be supervised by "credible international organisations like the UN". He also called for the release of all people who were arrested in protests held before and after the elections. Ivorian opposition figures like Pascal Affi N’guessan and Maurice Kacou Guikahue are still in detention. Bédié urged Ivorians to prepare for demonstrations intended to call for peace in the country. He asked the police and army to offer security to demonstrators. --BBC--
