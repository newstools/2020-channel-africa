Local media say more than 20 people were killed during the attack at Kitaya, which is located on the Rovuma river separating the two countries. Houses and vehicles were reportedly torched; among the buildings targeted was a house belonging to a candidate in elections due later this month. Some reports say Islamic State-linked militants active in Mozambique carried out the attack, but others suggest the violence may be election-related. --BBC--
