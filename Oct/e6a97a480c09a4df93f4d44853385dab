The body of Shannon Wasserfall, who went missing six months ago, was discovered after police were tipped off by an anonymous text message. Wasserfall had dropped off her son at a friend's house before heading out to meet someone. Activists have linked her disappearance and death to gender-based violence and have called for investigations to bring those responsible to justice.  --BBC--
