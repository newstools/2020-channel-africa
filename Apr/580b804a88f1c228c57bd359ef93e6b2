In a memo to its staff, Rwandair said the decision was made to “avoid laying-off staff”. It has also extended the suspension of contracts for pilots and non-essential staff until further notice. “This was an extremely tough decision, however, the choice we made is the best option at this time,” the memo stated. An air hostess, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told the BBC Great Lakes that the pay cuts was not a surprise. “It is very sad, we are always expecting the worst this time around. This is the hardest time I am going through in my four years with Rwandair,” she said. The carrier that flies to 26 international destinations in Africa, Asia and Europe stopped flights on  March 19 after Rwanda announced restrictive measures to halt the spread of the virus. The country reported eight new cases of coronavirus on Sunday taking the total tally to 191 with 92 recoveries and no fatalities.
