Speaking at PSG’s “Think Big” Series yesterday, De Ruyter said there was a need to ramp up the procurement of capacity above the 11 800 megawatts (MW) approved in a recently gazetted Ministerial Determination. De Ruyter said about half of the 11 800MW was not going to be available for the next 10 years as only 6 000MW in the Ministerial Determination was made of renewable energy. He said the generation capacity of renewable energy needed to be multiplied by the availability factor as the wind did not always blow and the sun did not always shine. “Before you really started, of the 12 gigawatts that we’ve got, about half is not going to be available within the next decade,” De Ruyter said. “And this comes at the same time as we are decommissioning between 8 and 12 gigawatts of coal-fired electricity, because our plants have simply become too old to operate. “And therefore, we are advocating, we are saying this is a fantastic first move. But give us more capacity, because the country needs it.” The Department of Mineral Resources was not immediately available for comment on the procurement of additional capacity. The 2019 Integrated Resource Plan allocated 1 500MW of new coal generation, with 750MW earmarked for introduction into the grid in 2023 and another 750MW for 2027. De Ruyter said it would be impossible to build capacity for the 1 500MW of new coal included in the Ministerial Determination within these set time frames. He said though this was definitely a move in the right direction and should be welcomed, building a new coal-fired power station was going to take time due to funding and regulations. --IOL--
