This follows a landmark lawsuit by the US Department of Justice (DoJ) over a similar issue in October. It is the tech giant's third US government-related lawsuit in two months. Google said in a blog that redesigning its search engine would "deprive Americans of helpful information". "We know that scrutiny of big companies is important and we're prepared to answer questions and work through the issues," wrote Google's director of economic policy Adam Cohen. "But this lawsuit seeks to redesign Search in ways that would deprive Americans of helpful information and hurt businesses' ability to connect directly with customers. We look forward to making that case in court, while remaining focused on delivering a high-quality search experience for our users."
