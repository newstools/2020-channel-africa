Rosh Hashanah is traditionally a time for big, family get-togethers. But under the new three-week lockdown, Israelis must stay within 1km (0.6 miles) of their homes, with exceptions, and the number of people allowed in synagogues has been greatly reduced. Israel currently has one of the highest COVID-19 infection rates in the world. In the past week, new cases have reached daily highs of more than 6 000, and the country's leaders have apologised for their failure to contain the pandemic. Israel has seen 1 169 deaths from COVID-19 and nearly 177 000 confirmed infections, according to a global tally kept by United States university, Johns Hopkins. It is said to be the first developed nation to reimpose nationwide curbs. However, the new national lockdown is widely unpopular, according to local media, with protests taking place before it came into force. Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has warned that if necessary, he will not hesitate to impose harsher restrictions. --BBC--
