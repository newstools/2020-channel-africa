It follows violence that marred a league match between the Kumasi-based side and Berekum Chelsea FC on Sunday. According to the GFA, the ban will remain in place until the disciplinary committee reviews the incident and takes a final decision. It condemned the violence and warned of sanctions for anyone found to have been involved in the incident. The violence was sparked when an Asante Kotoko player was sent off. Several fans attempted to assault the referee and police responded by firing rubber bullets into the crowd. One fan's eye was badly injured as a consequence and other fans and police officers sustained minor injuries. A number of police vehicles were also vandalised. The officer who fired the rubber bullets has been suspended while an investigation takes place. --BBC--
