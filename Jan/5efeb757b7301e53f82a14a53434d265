Al-Shabab has conducted six attacks in Kenya in the past month alone, killing over 25 and threatening more assaults. In Garissa, three teachers and three students were killed in the recent attacks. The BBC spoke to some of the teachers in the area. "Due to the trauma that we went through... I would not like to be in that area any more. I am traumatised, our colleagues are dead," said Lucy Wanjira, a teacher and a survivor of the al-Shabab attack. Wanjira, who works at Kamuthe primary school, a school thought to be among the safest in Garissa, heard the sound of automatic rifles outside her school residence one January night. She crawled under the bed, clutching her two-year-old child. Wanjira and two of her colleagues survived. Three others were killed in a separate room. The school is located some 200 kilometres from the Somali border. It also had a manned police post. But al-Shabab still managed to raid both the school and police post, and set it on fire. The attack sparked fear among public servants across the region. Teachers have been flocking to their regional office, some with bags already packed. But the Teachers’ Service Commission (TSC) is instead moving the teachers from one school to another within the county. "We already have a high shortage of teachers in this particular county. If we move them out of the county, then we will be creating a national crisis," said Andrew Mwanthi, regional director of TSC. It’s a tough situation for the government which has sent teams made up of military and special police forces, to fight al-Shabab in the areas bordering Somalia. "To win the war on terror, we require efforts of everybody from community level," said Samuel Njuguna, deputy county commissioner of Garissa.
