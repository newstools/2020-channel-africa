The vote count was delayed because of a dispute. Both the ruling party and the opposition now have 137 seats each -plus there is one independent Member of Parliament (MP), making up a total of 275 MPs in Ghana's parliament. This could pose a serious challenge to President Akufo-Addo's second term. He was declared winner of the December 7 elections but lost the 60% parliamentary majority he had in his first term. Even though the sole independent MP has pledged his support to the ruling party, the laws of the country require that a greater proportion of ministers be appointed from parliament. This means a number of the ruling party MPs doubling as ministers may not be in parliament at all time to push through, bills, proposals and contracts submitted for approval. Experts have said that a hung parliament will ensure an effective oversight role of the legislature but could also stall government programmes and policies especially if the opposition decides to frustrate the government.
