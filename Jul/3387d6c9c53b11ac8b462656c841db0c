Mexico is a key part of a wider international supply chain crucial to US carmakers, many of which operate factories across the border in Mexico due to lower labour costs. Chihuahua, where the state government has limited employee attendance to 50% in plants, is home to a Ford engine plant and many auto parts producers. US ambassador to Mexico, Christopher Landau, on Thursday said the Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker may have to shut some US car plants as early as next week if they fail to receive Mexico-produced engines. Kumar Galhotra, president of Ford’s Americas and International Markets Group, said the company had “several suppliers” operating under restrictions imposed by Chihuahua State. “With our US plants running at 100%, that is not sustainable,” Galhotra said in an emailed statement. “While we do not expect any impact to production next week, we are continuing to work with government officials on ways to safely and constructively resume remaining production,” he said. Mexico’s federal government has given automakers, mining firms and builders, with activities deemed essential, the green light to restart work, though some states have implemented their own restrictions as the coronavirus pandemic rages on. Landau said a senior Ford Executive told him on Wednesday night about the company’s concern over parts produced in Chihuahua State. --Reuters--
