The Minister Najib Balala clarified that the establishments were allowed to sale alcohol "only on room service basis". He said the clarification was with regards to hotels that have checked-in clients. The Minister warned that the rest of the establishments should strictly adhere to the president's directive and not to sale alcohol. President Uhuru Kenyatta banned the sale of alcohol in hotels and restaurants while extending nationwide curfew to prevent the spread of coronavirus. Hotels and restaurants that had opened to holidaying visitors had sought a clarification from the ministry as they had offered clients deals that included alcoholic drinks. --BBC--
