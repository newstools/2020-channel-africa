The call comes as the United Nations (UN) Health Agency comes under a sustained attack from United States (US) President, Donald Trump. The WHO Director-General,Â Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has called for an end to the politicisation of COVID-19. Meanwhile, the UN has warned that a severe coronavirus in South Sudan could have disastrous consequences for millions of vulnerable civilians. In South Africa, there's rising concern that the number of coronavirus cases in the country will continue to increase as the government launches a mass testing drive. South Africa has the highest number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Africa at 1845 with 18 deaths. One hotspot for the virus is the St Augustine's hospital in Durban in the KwaZulu-Natal province, where Health Minister, Zweli Mkhize, says around 48 staff have been infected. KwaZulu-Natal Health MEC, Nomagugu Simelane-Zulu, says the hospital is being closed in phases and an investigation is under way to establish how so many people can get infected at one institution. --SABCNews/BBC--
