"The congressional notification period of 45 days has lapsed and the Secretary of State has signed a notification stating rescission of Sudan's State Sponsor of Terrorism designation is effective as of December 14, to be published in the Federal Register," the US embassy said on Facebook. US President, Donald Trump, had in October said Sudan will come off the list after it pays compensation of $335 million to victims and families of al-Qaeda's 1998 bombing of US embassies in Africa. Sudanese Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok had responded by saying the funds had been transferred. Sudan was listed in 1993 when al-Qaeda leader, Osama Bin Laden, lived there as a guest of the government. It was along with Iran, North Korea and Syria. --BBC--
