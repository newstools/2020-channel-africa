Hakainde Hichilema of the United Party for National Development (UPND) has been accused of using his position as a consultant during the privatisation process to amass wealth, something he vehemently denies. Edith Nawakwi, who leads an opposition party, accused Hichilema of undervaluing some state-owned enterprises and becoming board chairman for some of them later. Chief government spokesperson Dora Siliya has issued a statement saying she is “studying” the matter. Her statement says that if the accusations are true, it would be "a clear case of corrupt practices". However, some Zambians believe the accusations are aimed at tarnishing Hichilema's reputation as he is President Edgar Lungu’s main threat ahead of next year’s general elections. --BBC--
