The tournament, which made its debut in Japan in 2019, was moved to the Los Angeles-area for 2020 at Sherwood Country Club as a concession to the COVID-19 pandemic. Tiger Woods is the defending champion. “While he is feeling much better, he is still a bit low on energy and feels it would be best to wait and resume his schedule in Houston,” Johnson’s agent, David Winkle, told Golfweek. The PGA Tour’s next event is the Bermuda Championship from October 29-November 1 before moving on to the Vivint Houston Open at Memorial Park Golf Course from November 5-8. Johnson, 36, is just the third player in PGA Tour history to win a tournament in each of his first 13 seasons, joining Jack Nicklaus and Woods. He has spent 100 weeks as the No. 1 player in the world over various times during his career. He moved back to No. 1 in the world in August with a victory at the Northern Trust to begin the 2020 FedEx Cup playoffs, then won the Tour Championship at Atlanta in September, taking the $15 million first prize. The 2016 US Open winner finished tied for second at the 2020 PGA Championship held August 6-9 at San Francisco. --Reuters--
