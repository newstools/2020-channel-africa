The event will take place simultaneously with the Girls U- 17 Championships. This regional showpiece had been postponed twice due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Cosafa’s Secretary-General, Sue Destombes says strict health protocols will be implemented. “We have three hotels for the teams – three senior national teams. The bulk of the team will be staying at the Town Lodge – an exclusive hotel for the team and no other guests. And certainly, all the precautions in the hotel in terms of the bio-bubble will be implemented.” Meanwhile, the South African Football Association (SAFA) and Multichoice’s video-on-demand service, Showmax, have entered into a five-year partnership to assist with the development of referees. SAFA says the partnership will help in equipping referees with the necessary skills from grassroots level so that they are adequately prepared for top-level refereeing. SAFA President Danny Jordaan says the partnership will also pave the way for more use of technology in local football including VAR technology in the next three years. Jordaan says it’s in line with FIFA’s vision.
