The Hillside Christian College Principal Wilma de Sousa said the teacher's views did not represent those of the school. She said that after consulting the legal team a decision had been made to suspend the teacher. According to the state-owned New Era paper, the Facebook account has now been deleted. The teaching assistant had posted racist comments in connection with the murder last Friday of a black Zimbabwean wood-carver in Namibia. Two of those accused of involvement were white men. It was a Namibian student in the US who alerted the school to the Facebook remarks. The teacher's comments come at the height of the Black Lives Matter protests over the death African American George Floyd at the hands of a white officer. --BBCâ€”
