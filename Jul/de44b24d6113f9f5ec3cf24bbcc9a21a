Herbert Gomba was arrested on Monday, the latest in a string of arrests of city council officials accused to illegally parcelling out land in the capital. He is expected to be charged with abuse of office. More than a dozen officials were reportedly suspended from the opposition Movement for Democratic Change Alliance-run city council to pave way for investigations into the alleged fraud. Police officers, including an Assistant Commissioner and a Public Prosecutor, have also been charged for allegedly receiving land to quash investigation. Some of the officials are alleged to have illegally sold over various pieces of land and prejudiced the council of close to $1.3 million. The residentsâ€™ associations have called for an independent audit into the affairs of the Harare City Council alleging long standing rot. --BBC--
