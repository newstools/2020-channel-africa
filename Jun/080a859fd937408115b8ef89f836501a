Former world No 1 Murray was playing just his second match since November following a bruised bone. The two-time Wimbledon champion showed impressive movement and all of his usual tenacity to take the first set, but Edmund hit back to win 6-7, 7-6, 10/5 behind closed doors in Roehampton. "To be honest, I am not bothered about the results of the match, after a match like that I hope my hip is okay, and I pull up well from it," Murray said. "I know if my hip is good, my tennis will only improve and get better over the next few months. If I can get consistent practice. "That is my hope. The hip feels good. If I play like that and do a few things better, sharpen up a couple of things, I will play high level tennis. "My groin is a little bit sore today, I felt it in practice and at the beginning of my match, but as the match went on, it felt alright." The often-injured Murray plays James Ward in his final group game, needing to win to make it through to the semi-finals. But the Scot is already looking at the much longer term as he plots a schedule that will see him arrive at the US Open in the best shape. The three-time Grand Slam champion is likely to return to the ATP Tour at Washington in August. "I am trying to avoid playing back-to-back events, my priority is to be fit for the Grand Slams," Murray said. --Afp--
