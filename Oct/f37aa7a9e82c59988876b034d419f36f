The announcement was made by Ahmed Shide, the country's Minister of Finance, during his presentation of the first quarter reports of Ethiopia's fiscal year ended July 7, 2020. The government had two years ago announced the full or partial privatisation of selected state-owned entities, including Ethio Telecom and Ethiopian Airlines. While addressing the media, Shide said, the airline has continued to generate much needed foreign currency for the country amid the pandemic. The airline is one of the biggest companies the Ethiopian government pledged to partially open for privatisation. But now, it says that Africa's largest airline will remain in the hands of the government, "at least for the time being." The airline previously said it had lost more than $900 million in earnings from passenger flights during the pandemic. However, officials noted that it was one of the few airlines across the world to stay relatively stable, largely due to a shift from passenger flights to cargo as countries closed their airspaces. --CNBCAfrica--
