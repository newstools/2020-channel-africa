Hamdok heads Sudan's transitional government following the overthrow last year of long-time President, Omar al-Bashir.

Hamdok's government is struggling to manage a severe economic crisis that triggered months of protests against Bashir and continued after his downfall in April.

Three witnesses told Reuters the attack happened near the northern entrance to the Kober bridge, which crosses the Blue Nile from Khartoum North to the city centre, where Hamdok'soffice is located. 

The convoy appeared to have been targeted from above, they said.
