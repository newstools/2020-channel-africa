Anderson, who recently returned to competitive tennis at the ATP Cup team tournament in early January, won in five sets 6-4, 2-6, 4-6, 6-4 and 7-6 (10/8). Ivashka, 25, has a career high singles ranking of 80th, but is currently a lowly 149 in the standings. The Belarusian came through a gruelling qualification process, finishing as the seven-best qualifier of the 19 who earned their way into the main 128-player draw. Anderson was unseeded at the year's first Grand Slam following a series of injuries that curtailed the second half of his 2019 season. Earlier on Tuesday, South Africa's Lloyd Harris lost 6-4, 6-2, 6-2 to Argentine 14-seed Diego Schwartzman.
