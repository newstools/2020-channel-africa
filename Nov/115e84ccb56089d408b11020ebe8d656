The expansion will result in the Switzerland headquartered concern’s throughput increasing by 30% from the current capacity. It is aimed at further strategically positioning the company on the local market as well as boost its exports into the region. The expansion coincided with the launch of two new products, Nestle Cerevita Instant Sour Porridge and Nestle Cremora with Milk. Officiating at the launch of the new products as well as expansion programme, Industry and Commerce Minister Dr Sekai Nzenza, said the investment by Nestle Zimbabwe will go a long way in expediting the country’s industrialisation strategy. “I would like to commend Nestle Zimbabwe for this investment worth $2.5 million, which will contribute towards our industrialisation agenda and improve capacity utilisation and employment creation in line with the recently launched National Development Strategy 1,” said Nzenza. The investment indeed attests to the confidence that your company has, in the potential and future of Zimbabwe,” she said. Nzenza assured the Swiss behemoth that Government will continue to provide the required framework that allows private businesses to thrive. Speaking at the same event, Nestle market head for East and Southern Africa Bruno Olierhoek, said the company is targeting to triple its $400 000 monthly exports from Zimbabwe. --Herald--
