For many workers, it’ll be a time filled with uncertainty and fear as businesses from mines, factories and shopping malls are going to shut down. Coal mines will, however, operate because they have to supply Eskom. Workers in their millions are required to stay at home for three weeks in line with a Presidential decree to fight the spread of the coronavirus in the country. Now, on the eve of the country lockdown, the Department of Employment and Labour has cautioned employers not to make their employees pay for the national sacrifice with their leave benefits. Employment and Labour Minister Thulas Nxesi explains, “Employers who can’t afford to pay their employees during the shutdown need not worry. The government stands ready to step in. Funds have been set aside to pay affected workers a minimum of $202 (R3 500) a month, which is the National Minimum Wage. Again, employers are being warned that enforcing the no work no pay rule during the country lockdown is prohibited,” says Nxesi. The South African Federation of Trade Unions and Cosatu says workers should not panic.
