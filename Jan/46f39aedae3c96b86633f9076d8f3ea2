The former Nissan Motor Co Ltd (7201.T) and Renault SA (RENA.PA) chairman became an international fugitive after he fled to Lebanon - his childhood home - last week to escape what he called a “rigged” justice system in Japan, where he faces multiple charges related to financial misconduct. He has denied any wrongdoing and has said he was the victim of “backstabbing” and a “conspiracy” that wanted to derail his efforts to bring the two automakers toward a merger. Japanese authorities said on Monday they may press for Ghosn’s extradition from Lebanon to face the charges, even though the Middle Eastern country does not normally extradite its nationals. On Tuesday, Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary, Yoshihide Suga, sidestepped questions about what exactly Japan had asked of Lebanon beyond “finding out the truth”. “It’s necessary to carefully consider the legal systems of both countries,” he told a news conference, referring to any requests for the extradition of a fugitive. Ghosn is due to speak to the media in Lebanon on Wednesday where he is widely expected to detail some of the claims he has made against Nissan since his arrest in November 2018.
