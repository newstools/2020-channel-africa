The west African country has in the last two days been conducting tests but none had turned out positive. It had seven confirmed cases of the virus but six patients recovered and one died. The ministry said all the six recovered patients will remain in isolation for 14 days to rule out any chances of infection. On Saturday, the ministry of health "praised God" for what it termed as the absence of the virus in the country. Mauritania confirmed its first case of coronavirus on March 13. A week later the country imposed a night curfew and banned international flights.
