Arap Moi occupied office for 24 years, from 1978 until 2002. He ruled the nation with an iron fist and was accused of human rights abuses. Under international pressure, he allowed multi-party elections in 1992, which were marred by widespread violence and allegations of rigging. Despite allegations of widespread corruption, human rights abuses and torture, he retained the affections of many ordinary Kenyans. Though many will remember him as a despot who reluctantly relinquished power, others credit him with preserving peace in a country surrounded by neighbours at war.
