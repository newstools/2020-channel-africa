The country says the bill contains discriminatory provisions against Chinese companies. “This is nothing but an unjustified political crackdown on Chinese enterprises listed in the United States,” Foreign Ministry Spokesperson, Wang Wenbin, told a daily news briefing in Beijing. “It will seriously hinder the normal listing of Chinese companies and distort the basic market economy rules that the US has always touted,” Wang said. Trump on Friday signed legislation that would remove Chinese companies from US stock exchanges unless they adhere to American auditing standards, the White House said, giving the Republican one more tool to threaten Beijing with before leaving office in January. --Reuters--
