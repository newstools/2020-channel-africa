Brent crude futures for November 2020 LCOc1 advanced to $46.38 a barrel earlier, the highest since March, and was fetching $46.27 by 0656 GMT, up 46 cents, or 1%. United States (US) West Texas Intermediate crude CLc1 was at $43.25 a barrel, up 28 cents, or 0.7%. Brent is set to close out August with a fifth successive monthly price rise while WTI is on track for a fourth monthly gain, having hit a five-month high of $43.78 a barrel on August 26 when Hurricane Laura struck. Abu Dhabi National Oil Company told its customers on Monday that it will reduce October supplies by 30%, up from a 5% cut in September 2020, as directed by the United Arab Emirates government to meet its commitment on the recent OPEC+ agreement. “With demand gradually recovering, this will allow the market to better absorb the inventory glut from earlier in 2020,” OCBC’s economist Howie Lee said. Energy companies continued efforts to restore operations at US Gulf Coast offshore platforms and refineries shut before the storm. A weak US dollar and a survey on Monday showing surprisingly strength in China’s services sector supported oil prices even though fuel demand has struggled to recover amid the coronavirus pandemic and supplies remain ample, analysts say, cautioning of hurdles for crude going forward. --Reuters--
