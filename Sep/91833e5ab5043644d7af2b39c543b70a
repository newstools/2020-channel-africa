It is hoped the deal with five rebel groups under the umbrella of the Sudanese Revolutionary Front (SRF), an alliance of rebel groups from Darfur and other opposition factions, will end 17 years of conflict in the western region of Darfur and the nine years of conflict in the Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile regions. The signatories met in Juba on Tuesday and agreed on an agenda. Dr Dhiu Mathok, rapporteur of the mediation team, told reporters that the parties agreed to discuss the “implementation modalities and matrix”. He said the discussions on the matrix will kick off on Wednesday and will continue for a number of days. In related news, President Salva Kiir has promised to “reach out” to the hold-out groups, the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement-North (SPLM-N) faction led by Abdelaziz Adam El-Hilu and the Sudan Liberation Movement (SPLM) mainstream faction headed by Abdelwahid Mohamed El-Nur, which boycotted the signing ceremony. “We are all Sudanese and we will never leave Sudan. What happened here in Juba is something that Sudanese all over the world celebrate. I hope very soon you will hear from some good news about my brother Abdelaziz El-Hilu and my brother Abdelwahid Mohamed El-Nur,” Kiir told representatives of the signatories during a party held at State House, which was attended by Sudan’s Prime Minister, Abdalla Hamdok. --BBC--
