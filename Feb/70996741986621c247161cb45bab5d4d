The company, the main electricity distributor in the East African nation, delayed publication of its results last November due to a vacancy at the auditor general’s office, which is responsible for auditing state-controlled firms. The results issued on Wednesday were not audited. The cost of buying electricity jumped by 18 billion Shillings ($178 095) during the period, Kenya Power said, blunting the impact of an increase in sales to customers. Finance costs also went up due to higher short-term borrowings, the company said. ($1 = 101.05 Kenyan Shillings) --Reuters--
