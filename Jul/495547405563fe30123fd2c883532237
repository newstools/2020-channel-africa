The three footballers were part of the Zambian Super Division show as the league eventually roared back into life on Sunday, after a false start the previous day. Reigning Soccer Star of the Year, Joel Ngodzo, speedy forward, Donald Teguru, and midfielder, Tafadzwa Rusike, featured for their Zambian sides on Sunday. It was a tumultuous 48 hours as Covid-19 positive cases, at the eleventh hour, threatened the restart of the league which had been suspended for four months. Former Dynamos striker, Evans Katema, had been set to get the ball rolling on Saturday after he was named in the Zanaco starting XI for the first match on Saturday at the Levy Mwanawasa Stadium in Ndola. However, that match was called off, at the last minute, when 28 members of the Forest Rangers squad tested positive for Covid-19. Fitness expert Thompson “Marubber’’ Matenda, was also supposed to be in action that day with his club Zanaco, where he is the team’s fitness coach. Matenda has been given a new nickname, “Sekuru,’’ at the Zambian club. All eyes had been on the scheduled match between leaders Forest Rangers against 10th placed Zanaco which would have marked the restart of the league after four months. However, after 28 of the Forest Rangers players and staff, from their squad of 58, tested positive, authorities were forced to postpone the opening match. The episode caused uproar with Zanaco, who demanded the three points after travelling to Ndola on Friday but were only informed hours before kick-off, on Saturday. And later on Sunday, two players each from Zesco United and Power Dynamos, tested positive in overnight testing conducted by health officials following Saturday’s chaos and had to be quarantined. Zesco United are home to Zimbabwean midfielder, Tafadzwa Rusike, who played in the match against Kansanchi Dynamos which ended in a 1-1 draw. --Herald--
