Vettel, 33, is moving to the team currently known as Racing Point from Ferrari, who earlier this year decided not to offer the German a new contract. Aston Martin said signing Vettel was "a clear statement of the team's ambition" to establish themselves at the front. "It's a new adventure for me with a truly legendary car company," said Vettel, who replaces Sergio Perez. A statement from Aston Martin said Vettel had signed for "2021 and beyond" but did not confirm the length of the contract. Typically, it would be expected the German has signed a three-year deal. Vettel said: "I'm extremely proud to say I will become an Aston Martin driver in 2021. "I have been impressed with the results the team has achieved this year and I believe the future looks even brighter. The energy and commitment of Lawrence Stroll to the sport is inspiring and I believe we can build something very special together. "I still have so much love for Formula 1 and my only motivation is to race at the front of the grid. To do so with Aston Martin will be a huge privilege." Team Principal Otmar Szafnauer said the team were "hugely excited" by the news. "Sebastian is a proven champion and brings a winning mentality that matches our own ambitions for the future as Aston Martin F1 Team," he said. "On a Saturday or Sunday afternoon, Sebastian is one of the best in the world, and I can't think of a better driver to help take us into this new era. He will play a significant role in taking this team to the next level." --BBC--
