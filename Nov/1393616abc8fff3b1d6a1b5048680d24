The 30-year-old had been living Maputo for a year and was attempting to board a plane to Vietnam when she was arrested on Monday, the City Police Spokesperson, Lionel Muchina said. A sniffer dog made the discoveries, he said. It's believed that the seized wildlife trophies may result from the killing of three rhinos and 12 lions - both species are protected by Mozambican law. Muchina said investigations are under way and criminal proceedings are in motion. There have been numerous arrests of Vietnamese citizens in Mozambique in recent years who have attempted to smuggle wildlife trophies out of the country. --BBC--
