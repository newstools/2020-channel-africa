Rift Valley Regional Co-ordinator, George Natembeya said there will be a seat, fizzy drink, bread and water for the 30 000 who will be sitting under a dome tent. Natembeya said the rest of the mourners will be allowed into the home but will not get sitting space in the tent. He said the snacks were also available for on "a first come, first served" basis urging mourners to arrive early. Transport will be provided from Nakuru town to Moi's Kabarak home about 20km away. Some Kenyans on social media have voiced their misgivings about the provision of free snacks to mourners. "Government so afraid of a low turnout, they had to bribe jobless Kenyans to attend the burial? Just wow," Modal Realism wrote. "Now they want a stampede at the funeral or they don't know Kenyans behaviour when they hear about free things?" Beaty Kuria wondered. "No, Mzee used to give out Milk... What is soda now!" Alfred Getuma retorted. "We eat in funerals, we don't do snacks," Stanley Msake said. --BBC--
