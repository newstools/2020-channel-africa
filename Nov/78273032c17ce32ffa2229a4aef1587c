In its half year performance results, Airtel Africa announced customer base growing by 12% to 116.4 million subscribers out of the 412.9 million mobile subscribers combined of the top three telecom companies in Africa MTN Group, Orange and Airtel Africa which represents more than 53% of total network subscribers on the continent. Covid-19 pandemic seems to be aiding growth of mobile money growth and data usage as different countries recommend cashless transactions and working from home strategy as a means to curb the spread of the virus. As a result of the situation, Airtel Africa in the six months to September 30 saw mobile revenues increase 15.3% due to growth in voice and data, while its mobile money operation Airtel Money saw revenue growth of 30.4%. In these unprecedented times, the telecoms industry has emerged as a key and essential service for these economies, allowing customers to work remotely, reduce travel, keep them connected and allow access to affordable entertainment,” said Airtel Africa CEO Raghunath Mandava. He added, “In these exceptional circumstances, in the first half, we delivered a strong set of results and as lockdown restrictions eased during Q2, our performance improved with constant currency revenue growth of 19.6%, up 6.6% from the prior quarter.” Mandava, however, added that the company remains alert to the potential for further disruptions from a second wave of Covid-19 pandemic across Africa, and the associated actions of governments to minimise contagion. Airtel Africa which currently operates across 14 markets, which span Eastern Africa, Francophone Africa and Nigeria, recorded a profit before tax of $0.5 million share of gain from joint ventures and associates compared to $0.4 million previous period. The operator said profit after tax for the half year ended September 2020 is lower due to benefits in the same period of the prior year of exceptional items of $47 million, other finance costs had derivative gain of $46 million in half year ended September 2019 and higher tax in half year ended September 2020. Airtel Africa has announced its diversification plan in the continent to compete with the top two Africa telcos companies, MTN Group and Orange. --TheEastAfrican--
