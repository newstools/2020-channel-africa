Delays are common in complex aerospace programs, but the especially slow progress is a potential embarrassment for China, which has invested heavily in its first serious attempt to break the hold of Boeing and Airbus on the global jet market. The most recent problem came down to a mathematical error, according to four people with knowledge of the matter. Commercial Aircraft Corporation (COMAC) engineers miscalculated the forces that would be placed on the plane’s twin engines in flight, known in the industry as loads, and sent inaccurate data to the engine manufacturer, CFM International, four people familiar with the matter told Reuters. As a result, the engine and its housing may both have to be reinforced; the people said, most likely at COMAC’s expense, though another source denied any modification. That and other technical and structural glitches meant that by early December, after more than two and a half years of flight testing, COMAC had completed less than a fifth of the 4200 hours in the air that it needs for final approval by the Civil Aviation Administration of China, two people close to the project told Reuters.
