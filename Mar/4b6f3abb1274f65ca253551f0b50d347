The City scout was present at the Stadion Rijeka for the home side’s 2-0 Croatian league win on March 8. And four players from the hosts’ dressing room are likely to have caught the eye with the Citizens targeting young talent from the region. In 2019 the club swooped to sign 18-year-old playmaker Ante Palaversa from Hajduk.

He has since spent time back at his former club and had been impressing on loan at Belgian top-flight side Oostende until football across Europe was interrupted recently. Top talent Ivan Lepinjica is among the four Rijeka players City should have on their radar.
