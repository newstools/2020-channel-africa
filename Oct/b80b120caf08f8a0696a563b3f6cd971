The Santam Group is one of the first JSE-listed companies to invest in SA’s latest analytical software for their South African business. This transaction extends SAS and Santam’s existing partnership in the field of data analytics, and the company’s data science investment reflects its confidence in the future of the South African economy. “Santam believes in the future of South Africa, and this is why we have chosen to invest in this type of technology. SAS Viya will make us more agile and able to improve and implement analytics much faster throughout our business processes,” says Kevin Wright, Chief Information Officer, Santam. SAS’ reputation within the industry is one of excellence, with modelling software that is accurate, relevant and reliable, that is accepted by the regulators. The adoption of SAS Viya extends a long-standing relationship between the two companies. Santam currently relies on SAS for other solutions spanning customer, fraud and risk areas. “In recent years, Santam has expanded its use of SAS solutions for real-time claims segmentation, claims fraud detection and compliance with IFRS 17 regulations. Now, in strengthening the partnership, SAS’ cutting-edge analytical platform, SAS Viya, will be implemented to enable their Advanced Data Analytics (ADA) capability,” explains Matthew Bray, Senior Account Executive at SAS. --IOL--
