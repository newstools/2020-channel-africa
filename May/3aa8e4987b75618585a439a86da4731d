MP Joanna Mamombe and youth leaders Cecilia Chimbiri and Netsai Marov were reportedly arrested on Wednesday while they held a demonstration over the government’s Covid-19 response. They were protesting about people allegedly going hungry while a lockdown is in place. The party tweeted that the three have been taken to a medical centre. The British embassy in Zimbabwe had urged authorities to urgently locate the three “in line with security services’ obligation to act at all times in line with Zimbabwe’s law and constitution". The US embassy had also expressed concern. --BBC--
