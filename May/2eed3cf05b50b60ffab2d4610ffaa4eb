A spokesperson for the Goverment of National Accord (GNA) announced the capture of al-Watiya airbase near the Tunisian border. It's a symbolic success for the counter-offensive that the GNA has been mounting against General Haftar's forces for the past month. The airbase has been an important asset for Gen Haftar for several years - its loss is another setback to his drive against the GNA from his power base in eastern Libya. --BBC--
