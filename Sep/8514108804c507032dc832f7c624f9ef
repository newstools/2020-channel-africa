French President Emmanuel Macron will on Friday meet his Ivory Coast counterpart Alassane Ouattara in Paris, the AFP agency reports quoting a source in the French presidency. Ouattara's decision to run for a third term as president in October's election has sparked tension and protests in the country. He had initially ruled out running for re-election, but reconsidered following the death of his preferred successor Prime Minister Amadou Gon Coulibaly, who had been nominated by the ruling party. His opponents say a third-term bid is unconstitutional. --BBC--
