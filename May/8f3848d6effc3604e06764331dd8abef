The academy at Sydney Motorsport Park will look to attract drivers from Australia, New Zealand, countries in East and Southeast Asia as well as the Indian subcontinent. The Italy-based team's Formula One driver Charles Leclerc came through the system, as did former world champion Michael Schumacher's son Mick, and Enzo Fittipaldi, the grandson of former world champion Emerson. "Our up-and-coming open wheel drivers will now have an even better opportunity to be part of the Formula 1 system at an early age," Motorsport Australia President Andrew Papadopoulos said in a statement. "Australians have proven throughout history that they can compete with the best in the world ... We believe this program will help us find the next Daniel Ricciardo or Mark Webber, and hopefully the next Australian Formula 1 World Champion." Ferrari F1 team Principal Mattia Binotto confirmed last year they were looking to add more drivers to their academy stables, including women drivers. --reutersâ€”
