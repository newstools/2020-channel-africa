In an appeal signed by South African Minister for Finance Tito Mboweni and his Ghanaian counterpart Ken Ofori-Atta, the African governments estimate that the economic disruption from the spread of coronavirus will cut the continent’s GDP by at least two to three percentage points this year. “Africa needs huge and immediate additional resources of $100 billion for the immediate response, with lead from the multi-lateral financial institutions,” reads the report released by Vera Songwe, executive secretary of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UN ECA), on behalf of African Ministers of Finance. Dated March 22, the appeal is addressed to the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the European Investment Bank, European Central Bank (ECB), the African Development Bank and other partner institutions like Afreximbank and regional development banks. Although the impact of Covid-19 on Africa is yet to reach the levels experienced in Europe, Asia and North America, the continent has so far lost an estimated $29 billion worth of GDP to the pandemic, according to Uneca estimates. With the economic crisis unfolding as the number of infections and mortality rises, Africa is appealing for a speedy disbursement of the bailout package in the form of suspension of debt service payments, budget support, extended credit facilities among other measures. --TheEastAfrican--
