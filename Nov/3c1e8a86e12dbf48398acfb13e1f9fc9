The Spain international was substituted during half-time of the 5-2 win on Saturday. Fati has played 10 games for Barcelona this season, scoring five goals and providing two assists. He broke a 95-year national record to become Spain's youngest goal scorer at the age of 17 years and 311 days with a strike against Ukraine in September 2020. --BBC--
