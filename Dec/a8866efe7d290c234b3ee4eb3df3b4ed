WHO Assistant Director General, Mariangela Simao, said in a briefing the global health body could decide on Pfizer’s vaccine candidate by the end of the year. A roll-out in a limited number of countries will take place by end-January or early February as part of the COVAX programme, led by the WHO to provide shots for poor- and middle-income countries, Soumya Swaminathan, WHO Chief Scientist, said. The comments came as Europe’s drug watchdog gave the green light for the use of the shot, taking the region a step closer to mass inoculation of the 450 million population as the United States and Britain roll out the vaccine. --Reuters--
