The accused faced allegations connected with a sit-in organised by Mohamed Morsi's supporters after he was ousted as president by the army in 2013. The charges included participation in the murder of security personnel who were sent to disperse the protest at Rabaa al-Adaweya Square in Cairo. The government said eight police officers died. Human rights activists say more than 800 protesters were killed. --BBC--
