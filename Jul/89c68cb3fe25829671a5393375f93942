The organisation's Emergency Chief, Michael Ryan, said what was happening in South Africa "may, unfortunately, be a precursor" and "a warning for what will happen in the rest of Africa". "While South Africa is experiencing a very, very severe event, I think it is really a marker of what the continent could face if urgent action is not taken to provide further support," he said. The WHO said cases in South Africa had increased by 30% in the past week, Kenya increased by 31%, Madagascar by 50%, Zambia by 57% and Namibia by 69%. Africa had reported 597 223 confirmed Covid-19 cases, including 9 691 deaths, by Monday according to the WHO statistics. --BBC--
