The agency says it needs $57 million between January and June 2021 to continue providing food to refugees living in Dadaab and Kakuma camps and in Kalobeyei settlement. WFP Kenya country Director, Lauren Landis, says a lack of funds had already forced the agency to cut food rations by more than one-third since September. She warned that stopping assistance "could have far-reaching consequences on stability and security in the camps and surrounding communities". The aid is usually delivered in the form of food and cash transfers. --BBC--
