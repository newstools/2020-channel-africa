Adidas said over 70% of its stores were currently closed worldwide, with a 35% rise in e-commerce in the first quarter only partially offsetting lost sales, which fell below average analyst forecasts. Its operating profit fell 93% to 65 million euros ($70 531 175) also missing analyst forecasts. Adidas said due to the uncertainties around how long its stores would stay closed, it is not able to provide an outlook for the full year. --Reuters--
