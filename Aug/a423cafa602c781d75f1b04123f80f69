The Euro strengthened versus the greenback and the Dollar index gave back some recent gains, barely changed mid-way this week following seven consecutive weekly declines. Recently battered technology stocks reclaimed leadership on Wall Street and the benchmark S&P 500 ended near record highs, even as US Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said the White House and top Democrats in Congress may not reach a deal on coronavirus aid. Both US parties traded jabs on who was to blame for blocking relief to tens of millions of jobless Americans. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 289.93 points, or 1.05%, to 27 976.84, the S&P 500 gained 46.66 points, or 1.40%, to 3,380.35 and the Nasdaq Composite added 229.42 points, or 2.13%, to 11,012.24. The S&P ended within 6 points of its closing record high of 3 386.15. The index slipped on Tuesday after seven straight days of gains. --Reuters--
