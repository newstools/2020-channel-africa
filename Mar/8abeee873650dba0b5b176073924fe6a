Only a fraction of Kenya’s estimated 100 000 healthcare workers had received any instruction in how to protect themselves, Seth Panyako, the secretary general of the Kenya National Union of Nurses, told Reuters.  

Government spokesperson Cyrus Oguna said he would check into the reports of the training and protective gear shortages.  

Kenya had reported 28 cases of the coronavirus and one death as of Friday. 

The virus has so far been multiplying across Africa more slowly than in Asia or Europe but the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned the continent’s window to curb the infection is narrowing every day.   

Nurses in the western Kenyan town of Kakamega and the coastal town of Kilifi ran away when patients with coronavirus symptoms came to their hospitals over the past two weeks, Panyako said on Thursday.       

Nurses at Nairobi’s Mbagathi County Hospital went on a go-slow protest last week in protest at a lack of protective gear and training. They feared catching the disease and infecting their families, Panyako said.             

“The government is not taking it seriously when health workers run away,” he said. “My clear message to the government ... give them the protective equipment they need.”
