Lionel Zinsou will not able to stand in next year's presidential election as a result, unless he successfully challenges the court of appeal's verdict. Zinzou's lawyer, Robert Dossou, told Jeune Afrique news site: "Their aim is clear - they want to make Lionel Zinsou ineligible. Those in power want to push aside any credible potential candidate for the 2021 presidential election." Benin's government has always denied this. Last month, Justice Minister SÃ©verin Quenum told the same news site that the country's judicial system was not being misused for political ends. --bbc--
