It came after a Fortnite update that let players buy in-game currency at a lower rate if they bought direct from maker Epic Games - bypassing Apple. Epic appeared to know the ban would come, announcing it had filed a legal complaint minutes after the removal. Apple takes a standard 30% cut of sales from its compulsory payment system. Hours later, Google also appeared to remove the app from its Google Play Store, though it remains available on Android phones through other means, such as Epic Games' own launcher. On iOS, the App Store is the only way to legitimately load apps. But Apple said Epic had taken the "unfortunate step of violating the App Store guidelines". Those guidelines ban any payment system apart from Apple's own, and has been the subject of several high-profile rows between developers and Apple. Epic said any iPhone players who already have the app installed should be able to continue playing until the game's next update rolls out. After that, they will lose some features. --BBC--
