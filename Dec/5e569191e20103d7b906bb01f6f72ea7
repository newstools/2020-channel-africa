The seven-time world champion missed the Sakhir Grand Prix in Bahrain last weekend after contracting coronavirus. Hamilton, 35, arrived in Abu Dhabi on Thursday after completing 10 days of quarantine in Bahrain. Fellow Briton, George Russell, 22, who starred on his Mercedes debut at the Sakhir Grand Prix as Hamilton's stand-in, will now return to Williams. Formula 1's governing body the FIA confirmed that Hamilton had returned a "number of negative Covid-19 tests" before travelling for the final race of the season. Mercedes had said it was "possible" they would make the decision as to whether Hamilton raced as late as shortly before Saturday's final practice session, which runs for an hour and starts at 10:00, three hours prior to qualifying. Hamilton released a video message on social media on Tuesday in which he said he was "feeling great" and had just completed his first physical training session since his positive test. "It has been one of the hardest weeks I've had for some time," he said, adding: "I hope I can get back in the car soon." Friday's first practice session begins at 09:00.
