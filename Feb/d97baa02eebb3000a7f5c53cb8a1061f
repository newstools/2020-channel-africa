The Chinese citizen, who arrived in the country seven weeks ago, went to a hospital in Lagos earlier this week with a fever, raising concerns. Lagos Stateâ€™s health ministry released the news on Twitter after rumours of a potential coronavirus case started spreading online. The statement urged Nigerians not to spread unverified news about the disease and emphasised the city's readiness for a potential outbreak. This is the 11 suspected coronavirus case in Nigeria to come back negative. Earlier this week, Algeria became the second country on the continent to confirm a coronavirus case, after an Italian man tested positive. Covid-19, the respiratory disease caused by the virus, has killed more than 2700 people. Most of the deaths have been in China, where the virus originated in December 2019. Globally, more than 80 000 people in more than 40 countries have now been infected.
