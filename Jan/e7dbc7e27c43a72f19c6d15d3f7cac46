Rouhani said they have never sought nuclear weapons with or without the nuclear deal and the European powers will be responsible for the consequences of violating the pact. In reaction to Washington withdrawal from the deal in 2018 and the reimposition of sanctions, Iran has gradually rolled back on its commitments. Rouhani said Iran remained committed to the deal and could reverse its steps away from compliance if other parties fulfilled their obligations.
