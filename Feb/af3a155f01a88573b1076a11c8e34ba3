The small southern African nation, among the poorest in the world, is heavily dependent on agriculture. The sector employs nearly 80% of the population and accounts for two thirds of export earnings, with maize forming the main food staple. But harvests recently have been hit by a combination of extreme heat and heavy flooding, with El Nino-induced drought in recent years combining with electricity shortages and political uncertainty to rip a hole in the economy. The country is targeting Gross Domestic Product growth of up to 6% this year after slack expansion of about 3% in 2018. The increase in maize production is thanks to increased yields because of favourable weather conditions, Gray Nyandule-Phiri said in a statement. The minister said that cumulative rainfall performance between November and January, the peak growing season, was much better than the same period last year. “Most parts of Malawi received well-distributed normal seasonal rainfall,” he said, adding that Malawi was experiencing “El Nino Southern Oscillation Neutral conditions”, which would bring improved rainfall until March. --Reuters--
