A number of people protesting against police brutality were on Tuesday night reportedly shot dead or injured in the country's biggest city, Lagos. The military has denied shooting at protesters although the Lagos state government has said at least 28 people were injured. "My heart goes out to all those who have lost a loved one in the violence. The US must stand with Nigerians who are peacefully demonstrating for police reform and seeking an end to corruption in their democracy," Biden said in a statement. He called for dialogue between the government and the civil society "to address these long-standing grievances and work together for a more just and inclusive Nigeria". Earlier, former US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, also called on Buhari and the army to "stop killing young #EndSARS protesters". Clinton started a new hashtag for the anti-police brutality protests tweeting #StopNigeriaGovernment: Lagos state Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has imposed an indefinite 24-hour curfew saying that criminals had hijacked the protests. The number of protesters killed on Tuesday is unclear but Amnesty International Nigeria said it had "received credible but disturbing evidence of excessive use of force occasioning deaths. --BBC--
