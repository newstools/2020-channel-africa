Biden took the lead in Georgia on Friday morning after Trump had held the advantage for several days while outstanding votes continued to be counted. The final margin is expected to be within a few thousand votes. “Right now, Georgia remains too close to call,” Raffensperger said at a news conference on Friday morning. “Out of approximately 5 million votes cast, we will have a margin of a few thousand. The focus for our office and for the county election officials for now remains on making sure that every legal is counted and recorded accurately.” “With a margin that small there will be a recount in Georgia”, said Raffensperger. By Friday morning, Biden held a lead of 917 voted with roughly 8000 ballots remaining to be counted in the state. --BBC--
