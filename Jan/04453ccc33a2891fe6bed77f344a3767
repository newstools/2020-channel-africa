The comments by Steven Udvar-Hazy, one of the founders of the airplane leasing industry which finances around half of the world’s passenger fleet, echoes a call by US President Donald Trump in April 2019 to “rebrand” its 737 MAX jetliner. Boeing said June 2019 it had no plans to change the name of the jet. “We’ve asked Boeing to get rid of that word MAX,” Udvar-Hazy told the Airline Economics aviation finance conference in Dublin. “I think that word MAX should go down in the history books as a bad name for an aircraft.” “The MAX brand is damaged and there is really no reason for it,” he added. Boeing is halting production of the 737 MAX this month following the grounding in March of its best-selling plane after two fatal crashes in five months killed 346 people.
