Magufuli’s main challenger, opposition leader Tundu Lissu, was shot 16 times in 2017 in what remains an unsolved case. He returned from three years in exile in July. People turned out early to cast their ballots in the commercial capital of Dar es Salaam on Wednesday morning. “The voting process is good, calm,” local pastor Clement Fumbo told Reuters after voting. “I expect the election to continue to be peaceful, fair and free.” Magufuli, 60, urged voters to turn out after he cast his ballot in the capital, Dodoma. “Let me also implore that we maintain peace as there is life after elections,” he said. Lissu, 52, told Reuters he was getting reports of widespread irregularities and his party’s representatives were being prevented from entering polling stations. “I am told turnout is massive,” he said. “The only worry is these irregularities...we will not accept a rigged election.” Many Tanzanians complained they were experiencing problems accessing social media platforms. “Authorities are now trying to block VPN services,” said ProtonVPN, an open source VPN provider, on Twitter. On Tuesday, both Twitter and Internet blockage monitor NetBlocks reported widespread problems. “We’re seeing some blocking and throttling of Twitter,” Twitter said in a statement from its public policy account. In the semi-autonomous archipelago of Zanzibar, local media reported calm, after two days of unrest. Police said they used tear gas and arrested youths blocking the offloading of ballot boxes.
