Manufacturing activity in China expanded at the fastest clip in nearly a decade in August, as factories ramped up output to meet rebounding demand, a private survey showed. New export orders rose for the first time in 2020. The upbeat findings contrasted with an official survey on Monday, which showed China’s factory activity grew at a slightly slower pace in August. But fears of a resurgence in infections in some economies may discourage firms from boosting capital expenditure and delay a sustained rebound for the Asian region, some analysts say. 

“In most major economies, except for China, factories are still running well below pre-pandemic capacity levels,” said Ryutaro Kono, chief Japan economist at BNP Paribas. “The recent recovery is largely due to pent-up demand after lockdown measures were lifted, which will dwindle ahead.” China’s Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index rose to 53.1 in August from July’s 52.8, marking the biggest rate of expansion since January 2011. Japan and South Korea both saw factory output contract at the slowest pace in six months in August, reinforcing expectations the region’s export powerhouses have past their worst from a collapse in demand after COVID-19 struck. The spill-over to other parts of Asia, however, remains patchy. While manufacturing activity rose in Taiwan and Indonesia, they slid in the Philippines, Vietnam and Malaysia. --Reuters--
