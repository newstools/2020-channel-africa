With many countries recording an unprecedented surge in the number of infections, and the continent’s total cases surpassing the half million mark as per World Health Organisation data, Africa is forecast to suffer GDP losses of between $145.5 billion and $189.7 billion from the pre-Covid-19 estimated GDP of $2.59 trillion. In its latest African Economic Outlook 2020 Supplement report, the African Development Bank (AfDB) says that despite countries embarking on a cautious reopening of economies to stem further damage, the impact of the pandemic is bound to be severe. Losses are expected to be carried over to 2021 because the projected recovery will only be partial with losses ranging from $27.6 billion (baseline) up to $47 billion (worst case) from the potential GDP of $2.76 trillion without the pandemic. Cumulatively, the pandemic could lead to GDP losses in 2020–21 of between $173.1 billion and $236.7 billion in current value terms. Under the baseline scenario, real GDP growth is projected to fall by 1.7 % in 2020, corresponding to a GDP drop of 5.6 percentage points from the January 2020 pre-pandemic projections. If the pandemic continues beyond the first half of 2020, GDP growth would drop to 3.4 % from the rate of 3.9 % projected before the onset of Covid–19. “The most affected economies are those with poor healthcare systems, those that rely heavily on tourism, international trade and commodity exports, and those with high debt burdens and high dependence on volatile international financial flows,” the report says. East Africa is projected to have the most resilient performance amid the pandemic after entering the crisis with strong growth of 5.2 % in 2019. The region is projected to post growth of 1.2 % in the best case scenario and 0.2 % in the worst-case scenario. “The region is better shielded by its wider diversification and its lower reliance on primary commodities,” notes the report. Although the situation remains risky, countries in the region have started gradual re-opening of economies. --TheEastAfrican--
