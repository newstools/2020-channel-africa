Talking to BBC regional journalists, Johnson said: “I hope that we get a deal, it’s up to our friends ... They’ve done a deal with Canada of a kind that we want, why shouldn’t they do it with us? We’re so near, we’ve been members for 45 years. It’s all there, it’s just up to them.” He also said there was “every chance to get a deal”, adding: “It’s up to our friends and partners to be commonsensical.” --Reuters--
