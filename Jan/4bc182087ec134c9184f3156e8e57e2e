Dipulelo Thabane was assassinated in June 2017, two days before her husband’s inauguration. Thabane and his current wife Maesaiah, are alleged to have links to the assassination. Lesotho’s Deputy Police Commissioner, Paseka Mokete, sent a letter requesting to see the Prime Minister on Tuesday morning. This is the second letter requesting Tom Thabane to appear before the police – the first was sent in December 2019. In the letter, Mokote points out that the solving of the murder is not only of national interest but it has international implications as well. 
He tells Thabane that concern outside the borders that this case be timeously investigated. Meanwhile, the current Mrs Thabane Maesaiah is still on the run. Her warrant of arrest is still out and police don’t know her whereabouts.
