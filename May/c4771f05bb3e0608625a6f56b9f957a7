Google and its peer, Facebook Inc, had allowed their employees to work from home in early March following tough government-mandated restrictions to contain the coronavirus. Google said on Tuesday it would give each employee an allowance of $1 000, or the equivalent value in their country, to expense necessary equipment and office furniture, as it expects most of them to largely work from home for the remainder of 2020. There are a limited number of employees whose roles are needed back in the office in 2020 and they would return on a limited, rotating basis, Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai said in a blog post. --Reuters--
