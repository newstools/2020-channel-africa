The first group of more than 500 people left Mahama camp in eastern Rwanda early Thursday, after they had tested negative for coronavirus. The camp hosts more than 60 000 Burundian refugees. “I am extremely happy to be going back home, I fled with three children and I am going back with five and their mother, we are all fine,” Emmanuel Bizimana told BBC Great Lakes aboard one of the buses. A spokesperson for the UN refugee agency, Elise Villechalane, said more than 1800 refugees in the camp have registered to go back home. “We can’t take them all now because a transit camp to temporally lodge them in Burundi can only host around 500,” she told the BBC. --BBC--
