In an official letter seen by Sport24, Mthethwa requested that SAFA, the governing body that controls football in South Africa, "play an overarching role" in monitoring compliance during the resumption of all football activities. In line with the directive gazetted by government on 11 June in terms of the Disaster Management Act, both SAFA through its appointed compliance officers and the department of Arts, Culture and Sports will monitor the PSL's resumption of activities. This will be done through appointed compliance officers to ensure that the PSL are compliant to all measures they have committed to. The PSL is now being requested to submit all its compliance plans to SAFA for quality assessing which will then be forwarded to government to prepare its own monitoring plan. SAFA has been requested to additionally provide its own detailed compliance monitoring plan as to how its compliance team will be monitoring PSL activities and any other football-related activities during lockdown. It means that the PSL will now need to effectively report to SAFA in adhering to protocols. The two institutions have recently reportedly been at loggerheads regarding resuming the league with Mthethwa having to appeal to both to speak with one voice. Shortly after a Joint Liaison Committee was formed with members of both parties to formalise a plan to submit a proposal to government to safely resume football. SAFA has sought to clarify that a return to competitive matches will only be allowed if all teams fully comply with the first phase of a return to training. --News24--
