The US's African Command said in a statement that it had "verified photographic evidence" that the Wagner Group had been planting the mines "indiscriminately" around the capital Tripoli and toward Sirte, east of the capital, since mid-June. The statement said the Wagner Group had demonstrated "a total disregard for the safety and security of Libyans". Russia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt have backed the renegade general Khalifa Haftar in his fight to seize power from the UN-recognised Government of National Accord (GNA) in Tripoli. Turkey's military support for the GNA has recently tipped the balance and allowed its forces in June to repel Gen Haftar's 14-month advance on Tripoli and launch a counteroffensive. The front line has since moved east to the city of Sirte.
