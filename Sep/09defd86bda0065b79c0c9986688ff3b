The group said it would refocus the business back to basics and open itself to understanding the needs of its customers more. Chief executive Roy Bagattini this week said the process would involve a strategy to identify lower hanging fruits in the near term as annual sales declined 10.7 % due to Covid-19 disruptions. It said the business recorded a 24.1 % decline in sales during the second half of the year ended in June, severely impacted by the closure of stores in South Africa. The unit’s operating profit tumbled 59.5 % resulting in an operating margin of 5.5 %. Online sales, however, grew 41.3 % in the second half and 35.4 % for the year. “I have pointed out that I think we had our strategy wrong and there were question marks over the execution of our strategy,” Bagattini said adding that the focus would be on better understanding the group’s customers. “We need to truly understand our customers, what they buy, why they buy, how they buy and what solutions they are looking for and let that inform our strategy. “We have several brands, but they are not distinctive enough and create confusion in a customer’s mind. We are what I call overly assorted, we have too many products but they don’t resonate with the customers.” Bagattini said Woolies would identify ways to take advantage of growth opportunities for the home business. “We have not extensively focused on the home business. I believe we are either in it or we are out of it, and we have decided that we are in it and we are going to be a lot more serious in our home business and look at how we can grow that.” --IOL--
