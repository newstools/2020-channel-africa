The largest bank by assets and market share in Tanzania, CRDB had started its regional expansion in 2012 but had to put the plans on ice in 2016 due to financial inadequacy. The lender, now with improved cash flows and with close to $3 billion worth of assets, hopes to join regional banking giants Equity and KCB which have been racing towards transforming into Pan-African banks with assets in excess of $10 billion, only for their efforts to be frustrated by the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. CRDB, which is listed on the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange has lined up mineral-rich Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) as the first point of entry through Greenfield Investments in the next 12 months. The DRC has become a fertile hunting ground for top EA banks firms looking to consolidate their positions in a country tipped to become one of the richest economies on the continent and a driver of African growth, if it overcomes its political instability and improve governance, according to the World Bank. The DRC, which in 2019 formally applied for admission into the six-member EAC bloc has a population of about 85 million people with a low banking penetration at about 6%, placing the country amongst the most under-banked nations in the world. The country has already attracted the likes of Kenya-based Equity Group Holdings Ltd and KCB Group. --TheEastAfrican--
