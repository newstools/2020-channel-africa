Its mission is to support the transitional phase in Sudan, while the second stipulated that the African Union Mission in Darfur (UNAMID) be extended until the end of the year. The decision to form the new political mission, called UN Integrated Transition Assistance Mission in Sudan (UNITAMS) was drafted by Germany and Britain, and the Security Council unanimously adopted it. The resolution states that the Security Council “decides, once this resolution is adopted, to establish UNITAMS for an initial period of 12 months.” It requests the Secretary-General of the UN, António Guterres, to quickly appoint an envoy to head this new mission. This resolution provided for “the extension of the mandate of the UNAMID until December 31, 2020”. Sudan Prime Minister, Abdallah Hamdok, asked the UN, in January, to establish a political mission under Chapter VI that would help the transitional authority in Sudan support the peace process in the country. Since the overthrew of President Omar al-Bashir in April 2019, following an unprecedented popular uprising that lasted for months and interspersed with violent repression, Sudan has entered a political transition. In August 2019, the country has been governed by a mixed military and civilian government for a transitional period of three years. --TheEastAfrican--
