The Bushiris skipped bail in South Africa and fled to their home country saying that their lives were under threat. They are facing charges of money laundering and fraud in South Africa. An arrest warrant was issued by the South African government through Interpol and they surrendered to police in Malawi who arrested them and they spent a night in custody. They were then taken to the magistrate's court in Lilongwe where they were released on the basis that their arrest did not follow the right procedure. The state prosecutor had asked the court to allow police to keep the couple in custody for a further 30 days to allow South African government to formally submit an extradition request. Malawi prosecutors are appealing against the magistrate's court ruling. --BBC--
