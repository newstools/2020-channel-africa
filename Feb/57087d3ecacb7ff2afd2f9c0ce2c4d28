Hogan first visited the United States as EU trade chief three weeks ago, declaring at the time that the European Union (EU) bid to reset EU-USeconomic relations had got off to a good start. However, US President Donald Trump said after meeting European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen in Davos a week later that he would impose tariffs on imports of cars from the EU if no trade deal were struck. Hogan had been due to address a conference on the digital economy in Brussels on Thursday morning, but abruptly changed his plans. A European Commission spokesman said Hogan would hold talks in Washington with a number of US administration officials, including Lighthizer. “These meetings are part of the regular bilateral contacts being held at technical and political level in the framework of the discussions for a positive bilateral transatlantic trade agenda, launched by the European Union and the United States in July 2018,” the spokesman said.
