In the YouTube video, the doctors and nurses sing: "we're not supermen, we're just doing it with love". In July, the BBC found doctors and nurses at the Livingstone Hospital in Port Elizabeth exhausted and overwhelmed with Covid-19 patients. They described scenes at the facility as "like a war situation". There was blood and waste on the floors, a lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) for the staff, oxygen shortages, a severe shortage of ambulances, no ventilation and patients sleeping "under newspapers". Dr John Black - one of only two infectious disease specialists in a province with a population of about seven million - told the BBC at the time that "Covid has opened up all the chronic cracks in the system. It's creating a lot of conflict". But as the infection rate in South Africa begins to drop significantly, the situation at Livingstone Hospital appears to be improving. He told the BBC's Andrew Harding on Tuesday that the music video was a way of boosting morale: It’s about institutional healing. The numbers [of infections] are coming down. The surge stress has been relieved. This video was a way of paying tribute to those people who have really suffered and succumbed to the disease, and also a way to give strength to our staff and to build camaraderie and heal our institution at all levels.” It’s about institutional healing.
