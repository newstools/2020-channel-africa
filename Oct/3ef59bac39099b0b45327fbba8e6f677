The company on Thursday reported an 8% drop in revenue to £10.59 billion ($13.8 billion) and a 5% fall in adjusted earnings to £3.72 billion ($4.8 billion), broadly in line with expectations. Chief Executive Officer, Philip Jansen, said the performance had given it confidence to raise the lower end of its earnings outlook for the year from £7.2 billion ($9.3 billion) to 7.3 billion ($9.4 billion), with the upper end staying at £7.5 billion ($9.7 billion), and forecast earnings of at least £7.9 billion ($10.2 billion) for 2022/23. “This growth will be driven by the continued recovery from COVID-19, enhanced by sales of our converged and growth products, and by significant savings from our modernisation and cost saving programme,” he said. “In combination these factors will more than offset legacy product declines.” ($1 = 0.76 Pounds) --Reuters--
