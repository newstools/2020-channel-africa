The cases at Pumwani hospital were found after 290 staff members were tested, said Dr Patrick Amoth, the Acting Health Director General. He added that all those who tested positive were receiving home-based care and none of them required hospitalisation. Another 100 staff will be tested, he said. Amoth said that Pumwani hospital was safe and that health authorities will give the workers all the necessary support. Kenya has reported more than 10 000 cases of Covid-19 with 197 deaths since it confirmed its first case in mid-March. --BBC--
