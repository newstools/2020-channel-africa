The humanitarian group has not identified the deceased, or said when or how it happened. But its statement confirmed the aid worker had been serving in Hitsats refugee camp in Shire when they were killed. The organisation says it is "working in Tigray to support 96 000 refugees in four camps with a range of services, including clean water, sanitation, and education". The conflict in Ethiopia's Tigray region between federal and regional forces has forced thousands of people to flee. Some have gone to refugee camps in neighbouring Sudan. The Ethiopian government has previously denied claims that humanitarian assistance in the region was impeded by ongoing fighting.
