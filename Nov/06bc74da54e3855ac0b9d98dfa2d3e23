Chadema party chairperson Mbowe and other senior members of the main opposition group were arrested after calling for mass protests against the landslide victory of President John Magufuli in last week's election. A BBC correspondent in Tanzania says people do not appear to have heeded the protest call. The opposition has demanded a re-run of the poll, in which the UK and the United States said there had been systematic interference. --BBC--
