Nobody has claimed responsibility for the attack in the Nsam neighbourhood of Yaoundé, which police say was carried out with a homemade bomb at about 21:00 local time (20:00 GMT). Witnesses tell the BBC they saw a man enter, buy a drink and sit alone before walking away, leaving his drink and a bag behind. Christine, who was in the bar, told the BBC she only remembers something exploding in the bag, before the force of it threw her against the wall. Police say two of the four people who were wounded have serious injuries. All are receiving treatment at a clinic in the area. In August, a similar explosive device went off in Yaoundé's crowded Mokolo market, injuring a number of people. Two months earlier, the country’s capital recorded three explosions in different localities. Two people had been arrested in connection with those previous explosions, no arrests have been made in relation to Sunday's incident. --BBC--
