The European Union (EU) executive is drawing up new rules for data-sharing and the digital marketplace as well as boosting competition after concluding that multiple antitrust actions against Google have been ineffectual. The Commission’s public consultation period ends on September 8. In a blog post and 135-page submission, Google encouraged European legislators to provide greater clarity on rules and responsibilities of online platforms. It said while it was important to identify illegal content, mandating use of technology to do that could ‘overblock’ Europeans’ speech and access to information. The Commission should update its rules with a graduated scheme of exemptions from liability, including for search engines or cloud services, Google said.
