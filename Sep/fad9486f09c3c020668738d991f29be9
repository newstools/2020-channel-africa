The official in charge of security in the region, Abera Bayita, on Wednesday dismissed local media reports that more than 80 people were killed in the attacks but blamed the opposition parties for the violence. They did not give a figure for the number who had died. Benishangul Gumuz is made up of different ethnic groups and politicians are saying the violence was related to ethnicity. A survivor told the BBC Amharic service that he fled to the forest when the attackers came to his home. Several homes were destroyed and some local residents say they are still tracing their family members. --BBC--
