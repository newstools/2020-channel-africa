An investigation by the UN Environment Programme found that between 2015 and 2018, 14 million old, poor quality vehicles were exported from Europe, the US and Japan. More than 40% of them went to Africa. Few African countries have regulations on car imports. In Uganda the average age of a diesel vehicle imported in 2017 was more than 20 years old. --BBC--
