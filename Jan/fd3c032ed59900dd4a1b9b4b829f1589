South African track cyclists Jean Spies and Charlene du Preez won gold in their respective sprint races on day three on Sunday of the African Track Continental Championships held in Cairo, Egypt.

Spies and top female sprinter Du Preez led a group of South Africans that scooped most of the gold medals on offer in Cairo. This was Spies’ reaction. Joshua van Wyk and Steven van Heerden claimed gold in the Elite Men’s Madison, while Danielle van Niekerk and Ilze Bole won gold in the women’s event. David Maree won the Elite Men’s points race. However, the stand-out star performer in the women’s race was Du Preez who won gold in three different events, the Individual Sprint, Kieran and Time-trial.
