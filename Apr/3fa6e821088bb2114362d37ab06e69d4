Motaung was speaking at a press conference on Wednesday where Chiefs, rivals Orlando Pirates and MultiChoice announced a joint effort in combating the spread of Covid-19 in the country. That effort centres on protecting those on the frontline of the fight by donating much-needed personal protective equipment to help stem the pandemic. This includes masks, gloves, goggles, shoe protectors as well as 4 000 testing kits. Motaung said the donation would help protect healthcare workers, law enforcement officers as well as those conducting tests throughout the country. "We are forever indebted to the sacrifices of healthcare workers and law enforcement officers who are spending long hours in the trenches – those entrusted with the responsibility of going into our communities to conduct public screening and testing. This protective gear will go a long way to protect them – the people who are mostly at risk of contracting the virus while on the line of duty," he said. Irvin Khoza, chairperson of Orlando Pirates said his club were "thrilled" to be part of the investment to fight Covid-19 along with Kaizer Chiefs and MultiChoice. “After the Premier Soccer League took a decision to suspend football for the rest of the season to mitigate against the spread of the virus, the Orlando Pirates family is thrilled to be part of this investment. "Our nurses and law enforcement officers are like the backline in any soccer team – they are the last, if not the only, human shield that will protect us from conceding to the pandemic. This is why we are grateful that MultiChoice, Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates, who are usually our rivals in the iconic Soweto Derby, have agreed to work with us as a united front to make this investment,” said Khoza. To date, the pandemic has claimed 34 lives and infected 2 506 people in the country. --news24--
