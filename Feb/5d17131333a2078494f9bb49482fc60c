The commission will on Tuesday convene permanent and non permanent members of the National Electoral Commission, as well as the representatives of President-elect Umaro Sissoco Embaló and Domingos Simões Pereira. The electoral body said Embaló had won 54% of the votes against Pereira's 46%. State-run Guinea-Bissau News Agency (ANG) said the recount is meant to comply with a Supreme Court ruling that has raised uncertainty about the president-elect's swearing in on February 27. The electoral commission had previously said that it had exhausted its authority in the matter of the electoral process, adding that there was nothing else it could do.
