Minster Ali Moselhi emphasized that the commodity exchange will provide protection for small farmers and producers by collecting the production, classifying it and making it available to all traders on the stock exchange platform in a form of an organized market. This according to Moselhi will contribute to increasing the competitiveness of small farmers and producers. He added that this announcement will encourage small traders to enter into the organised trade system, which will be reflected on the commodity prices for the benefit of the consumer and the producer. The establishment of the commodity exchange management company comes in accordance with President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi directives on controlling markets, providing commodities, on affordable prices to consumers. Assistant Minister of Supply and Internal Trade and head of the Internal Trade Development Authority, Ibrahim Ashmawy said that the commodity exchange company aims to reduce the circulation of commodities between farmers and producers, right up to the consumer. Previously, Minister of Supply and Internal Trade Ali Al-Moselhi, emphasised that the existence of approved warehouses is indispensable for the start of the commodity exchange project, explaining that it organises supply and demand processes and through which the owner of the commodity or the farmer can advertise his products.  --EgyptToday--
