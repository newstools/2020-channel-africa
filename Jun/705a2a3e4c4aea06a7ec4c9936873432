Last week in Katsina State, 150 gunmen on motorcycles opened fire on residents, looting shops and stealing cattle in the village of Kadisau. In a statement tweeted by his spokesperson, Buhari said he had approved a joint military and police operation to fight the bandits in the states of Niger, Kaduna, Katsina, Zamfara and Sokoto. "Buhari appeals to the people of Katsina State to be patient and supportive of the ongoing military operations in the state, while sympathising with those who are bereaved, injured and lost properties," said President's Spokesperson, Garba Shehu. Nigeria's ministry last month said it had launched air strikes to halt a number of attacks. --BBC--
