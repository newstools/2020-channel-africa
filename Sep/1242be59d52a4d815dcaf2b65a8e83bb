The Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), which dominated Ethiopian governments for decades, warned of escalating unrest if the current ruling coalition tried to obstruct the regional poll. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has downplayed the significance of the polls, saying the TPLF has an extended mandate to stay in power - according to a decision by Ethiopian Upper House of Parliament in June. This is after national elections were delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic. He said the current elections would not make any difference on that decision. He also reiterated that his government will not seek military confrontations with the state. “[The election] It’s not legal- because it’s only the electoral board that can conduct elections in Ethiopia," he said in an interview aired on state TV on Tuesday night "But what I want the people of Ethiopia and opposition parties to understand well is that TPLF has been the government in the region over the years… It's mandate to continue to be the government of the region has been extended until the next [national] election… Village conventions and conferences like this one shouldn’t be and aren’t big headaches for us. “As for me, I don’t believe Ethiopia needs war. I don’t want to be included among people in favour of military measures. What I want to send to Tigray is not a bullet, I’d rather send a face mask [that can be used against] coronavirus." TPLF leaders have been involved in a series of disputes with the administration of Abiy. The party was kicked out in a reshuffle by the prime minister last year. It accuses him of a power grab. Five parties are due to take part in the Tigrayan poll, while some others are boycotting the event. --BBC--
