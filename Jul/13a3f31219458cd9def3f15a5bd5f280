Hachalu's killing on Monday sparked deadly protests in which more than 80 people died. The artist was seen as a hero among his Oromo ethnic group for his defiant message and support of Oromo activists, who had long complained of economic and political marginalisation. The motive for his killing remains unclear, but the 34-year-old had said he had received death threats. --BBC--
