Earlier this week the government imposed a night curfew in the capital and a full lockdown in the neighbouring province of Blida. The country has so far reported 367 cases of the illness, with 25 deaths. Most cases have been in Blida, south of Algiers. The curfew extension, to be enforced from 7 pm. to 7 am. will include central, eastern and western provinces where coronavirus cases have been rising. There have been no reported effects on the countryâ€™s oil and gas production.
