All sporting activities were suspended prior to the country entering a 21-day lockdown to help prevent the spread of the virus. Assuming the Absa Premiership is able to resume, the PSL will follow the South African government’s regulations. Speaking to Independent Media, Madlala explained: "We can't create our own regulations as football. We will follow the regulations of the country. "What are they saying? You know the regulations (you only get tested when you have signs of the symptoms that shows you might have coronavirus). We can’t fight against them. We can’t change the regulations. "All we are saying as the PSL is that we will comply with the regulations of the country. We are not above regulations as football. That must be clear." Madlala acknowledged that there is a possibility that football won't resume anytime soon, adding: "If the regulations are making it possible for us to play then we will continue. "If the regulations at that time are making it impossible for us to play, we won’t play. We won’t kick a football if it means we are not complying with regulations. That’s key." --news24—
