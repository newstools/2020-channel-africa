This is the first resignation to hit the board since Prime Minister Aby Ahmed reconstituted it after taking office in 2018, with a promise to hold free and fair elections. But the polls - originally scheduled for last month - have been postponed until next year. The board cited the coronavirus outbreak as the reason for the postponement, but the opposition says it is aimed at helping Abiy cling to power. While the reason for the resignation is unclear, it might signal a lack of confidence in the political transition and preparations for elections, says the BBC's Kalkidan Yibeltal in the capital, Addis Ababa. --BBC--
