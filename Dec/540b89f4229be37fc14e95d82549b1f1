The Bureau for Economic Research (BER) said yesterday that the FNB/BER Consumer Confidence Index (CCI) rose to -12 index points in the fourth quarter, from -23 in the previous period. This was still the lowest festive season reading since 2015, and was below the average reading of 2 index points since 1994 as consumers were concerned about the future. The index, however, has now regained most of its lost ground after crashing to a 35-year low of -33 index points at the height of the Covid-19 outbreak during the second quarter. All three sub-indices of the CCI rose handsomely during the fourth quarter. FNB chief economist Mamello Matikinca-Ngwenya said the further easing of restrictions and an uptick in economic activity had greatly benefited low-income households. Matikinca-Ngwenya said low-income households and the unemployed would also have been relieved to hear of the extension of Covid-19 social relief grants. Matikinca-Ngwenya said slight declines in petrol and paraffin prices may also have bolstered low-income confidence during the fourth quarter. --IOL--
