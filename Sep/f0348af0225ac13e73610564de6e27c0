The Porcupine Warriors, who hail from Kumasi and have won two Champions League (then known as African Cup of Champions Clubs) titles in 1970 and 1983, will play the upcoming season’s continental matches at the Accra Sports Stadium, rather than their usual Baba Yara Sports Stadium which is undergoing renovations. Asante have been given the chance to represent Ghana in the CAFCL for a second straight campaign following the Ghana Premier League’s pandemic-enforced cancellation of the 2019-20 season. In the most recent Champions League (which is still to be completed in the coming weeks) Asante were knocked out of the first round by Tunisia’s Etoile du Sahel. “With the renovation at the Kumasi Sports Stadium, Kotoko will play their home matches at the Accra Sports Stadium,” Ghana Football Association head of communications Asante Twum told Asempa FM, as quoted by Football Ghana. “I am sure the Club Licensing Board will deal with that and communicate to the club but what I know is that they will play at the Accra Sports Stadium,” he added. The qualification rounds of the 2020-21 Champions League are scheduled to begin in late November. --AllAfrica--
