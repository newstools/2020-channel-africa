The country sold more than 58 400 tons of avocado to 42 countries in the first half of the year, nearly matching the amount exported last year. It earned more than $75 million from the exports. “The high export numbers can also be attributed to an increase in avocado acreage and quality of the fruit being produced by our farmers. “We are excited by the prospects of rising demand for the fruit,” the paper quotes the Chairperson of the Avocado Society of Kenya, an association of avocado growers, as saying. Kenya is ranked among the world's top producers of avocado. --BBC--
