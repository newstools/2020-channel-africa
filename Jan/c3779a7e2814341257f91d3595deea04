According to ESPN, the Ajax Amsterdam midfielder sits top of the Blues transfer wish list and while they are eager to complete a deal this month, they will continue their pursuit onto the next transfer window at the end of the 2019-20 season. Ziyech has been linked with a move away from the Johan Cruyff Arena for the past few seasons and despite growing interest following Ajax Amsterdam’s run to the UEFA Champions League semi-finals last season, he remained in the Netherlands capital. The 26-year-old has carried his good form into the current campaign and has assisted an incredible 21 goals in 29 games this season, while also chipping in with eight goals across all competitions. In total, he has been directly involved in 130 goals in just 159 games since joining the Dutch champions four years ago. Chelsea are not the only club interested in signing Ziyech with Manchester United, Arsenal and Manchester City all having been linked with a move for the midfielder. --AllAfrica--
