At least one person died in the capital Conakry during clashes between opposition supporters and police. Initial results suggest that President Alpha Condé, who is 82, is ahead in the poll. On Monday, his main challenger, Cellou Dalein Diallou, complained of fraud and declared himself the winner. There's been repeated violence since President Condé's decision to seek a third term, which required a change in the Guinea's constitution. --BBC--
