United’s promotion was confirmed on Friday night when West Bromwich Albion were beaten 2-1 by Huddersfield Town, ending a 16-year absence from England’s top flight. Radebe spent 11 years with Leeds from 1994 to 2005 and is a bona fide club legend at Elland Road, having made over 250 appearances, worn the captain’s armband and helped the club to reach the semifinals of the UEFA Champions League early in the 21st century. Radebe even remained with the club when they were first relegated in 2004, though he was forced to hang up his boots a year later due to injury. Leeds dropped as low as League One (third tier) in the late 2000s, but they have gradually worked their way back up the ladder and the appointment of highly-regarded coach Marcelo Bielsa, known fondly as ‘El Loco’, in 2018 has culminated in a confirmed return to the elite. --AfricaNews--
