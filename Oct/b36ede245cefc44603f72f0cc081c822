This is the nation’s only trial related to the deadliest Islamist attack since the 1998 US Embassy bombing. A third man who also faced charges under the country’s terrorism prevention act was acquitted on all charges. The judgment comes more than seven years after gunmen from the Somali militant group al Shabaab massacred at least 67 people inside the Westgate shopping mall, seen at the time as symbol of the East African nation’s growing prosperity. --Reuters--
