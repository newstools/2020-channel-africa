General classification contender Steven Kruijswijk, who rides for Jumbo, tested positive as did four staff members of the Australian Mitchelton-Scott team. Out of 571 tests, Team Sunweb's Michael Matthews also tested positive. Mitchelton-Scott's British rider Simon Yates, another pre-race favourite, tested positive before stage eight. "As a social responsibility we've made the decision to withdraw," said Mitchelton-Scott boss Brent Copeland. Kruijswijk, ruled out of last month's Tour de France because of a shoulder injury, said: "Within the team we take a lot of measures to avoid contamination. "And I just feel fit. I can't believe I got it. It is a very big disappointment to get this news. It is a pity that I have to leave the Giro this way." In a statement on their website, Team Sunweb said: "Michael is currently asymptomatic, feels healthy and is now in quarantine." A staff member from Team AG2R-La Mondiale and Team Ineos Grenadiers also tested positive and are now isolating. The latest rounds of tests were carried out on 11 and 12 October. In Tuesday's stage 10, three-time world road champion Peter Sagan won the undulating 177 kilometres run from Lanciano to Tortoreto on the Adriatic coast. It was an eventful stage in which Slovakian Sagan survived from the early breakaway and stayed out in front, fighting his way up steep climbs in heavy rain, as well as negotiating slippery descents on new tarmac. --BBC--
