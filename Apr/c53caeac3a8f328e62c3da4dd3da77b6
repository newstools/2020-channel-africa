The cost of crude had fallen to 18-year lows as the two countries slashed prices and ramped up production. At the same time demand has been hit hard by shutdowns around the world to slow the spread of the coronavirus.

United States (US) oil has just seen its worst quarter on record, falling by two thirds in the first three months of the year.
Speaking about the dispute at a White House news conference, Trump said: "It's very bad for Russia, it's very bad for Saudi Arabia. I mean, it's very bad for both. I think they're going to make a deal".

He added that he expected them to "work it out over the next few days" after he spoke to both countries' leaders.

Brent crude oil rose by more than 10% to over $27 a barrel, while US oil was some 9% higher.
