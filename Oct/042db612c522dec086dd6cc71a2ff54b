The Middle East has become a popular destination for African women to move to for work as maids with an estimated three million women from Africa working in Gulf states. But some end up in dangerous situations. Three women in their twenties who have returned to Ghana from Lebanon, complain of long shifts - sometimes as long as 14 hours without food. One said that her boss drugged her. Two of the three said their boss tried to rape them. At the root of the problem is a visa system called Kafala which makes workers extremely vulnerable, says Asie Kabukie Ocansey from the Nekotech Centre for Labour Migration.

The UN youth association is also urging African leaders to ratify the Domestic Workers Convention to protect the rights of domestic workers - especially young women working abroad. Â
