A state official, Abiola Seriki-Ayeni, in a statement said schools will reopen on January 4 but students in boarding schools will resume a day earlier. She urged parents to ensure their children follow the Covid-19 guidelines at home and asked school administrators to ensure compliance in January. Schools in Lagos state resumed in September 2020 after months of closure because of the coronavirus pandemic. They closed briefly and resumed in November because of the anti-police brutality protests that took place for weeks. The state government had to harmonise the school calendar after the interruptions. --BBC--
