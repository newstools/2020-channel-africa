The one-day exercise, held at the compound of the MHD in Paynesville, outside Monrovia, was conducted by the National Action for Economic Empowerment and Development (NAFEED) with support from the United Nations Development Program under its Green Climate Fund Small Grant Project. The program is intended to promote physically-challenged farmers' participation in biodiversity conservation in rural communities. Speaking to reporters following the training, the Program Manager of NAFEED, Jenneh Korlison, noted that the program is intended to build the capacity of the disabled in growing their crops and vegetables through organic approach, rather than using chemicals that tend to destroy crops and post danger to humans. According to her, the program is a means of helping disabled farmers to make livelihood through a sustainable development plan. "It is intended to help farmers make livelihood through sustainable means of the soil. We are having this training to educate farmers, especially the disabled to learn new techniques, so that they will graduate from those poor practices of use of chemical fertilizer and pesticides, which causes bio-diversity degradation," she stated. "Those chemicals that we use cause serious harm on the soil and the plants as well as we, humans. This training is all about educating the people in using local resources that are available in the environment such as the faeces of pigs, cows, and others. This will in fact, reduce production cost and disease outbreak. In remarks, the Executive Director of MHD, Victor Wilson, said training provides great opportunity to disabled farmers through the acquisition of new knowledge. --AllAfrica--
