The US threat has sent shockwaves through the anti-doping community and prompted several governments to urge WADA to introduce legislation that would find the US non-compliant with the WADA Code, effectively barring American athletes from international competition. “The consequences of a withdrawal of WADA funding by the US could be more severe and far reaching for American athletes,” WADA president Witold Banka told Reuters. “We have been approached by a number of governments of the world that were shocked by the threats from the US government supporUnited States Anti-Doping Agency. “These governments want us to consider an amendment to the compliance standard meaning that non-payment by a government of its WADA contribution could lead directly to that country’s NADO (National Anti-Doping Organisation) being declared non-compliant with the World Anti-Doping Code. “Inevitably this could have serious repercussions for athletes from that country including their participation in major international sporting events.” The Tokyo Olympics have been delayed by a year until July 23 to August 8, 2021, because of the novel coronavirus pandemic. International Olympic Committee (IOC) rules stipulate there needs to be WADA compliance to allow Games participation.
