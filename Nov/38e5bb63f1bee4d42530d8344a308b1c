The shortage has hampered travel between borders of the two countries particularly Lesotho nationals who travel regularly. Pandor made the comments at the South Africa-Lesotho Joint Bilateral Commission of Cooperation held in Maseru this weekend. The intensive three-day meeting marks a new era on how the two countries relate on matters of trade, cross border movement of goods and services as well as smooth transfer of school-going children across the borders. Pandor has committed to assisting in resolving the issue of the rapid tests. “Our colleagues now that we have revived the commission, they will interface far more than has been the case in the past, which was the reason for President Ramaphosa and Prime Minister Majoro directing us to meet as the ministerial commission to iron out the difficulties that confront us and ensure that we cooperate and stay in constant contact and not sit with problems and develop a resentment which is entirely unnecessary,” says Pandor. --SABC--
