The star fly-half is joined by uncapped trio Scott Steele, Oli Kebble and Duhan van der Merwe, with the latter two qualifying on residency grounds. Back row Blair Cowan, 34, is selected by head coach Gregor Townsend four-and-a-half years after his last cap. "Finn has been available since the end of the Six Nations," Townsend said. "We had conversations towards the end of the Six Nations and on all way through the summer that have carried on as recently as a few days ago." Russell was suspended for his breach of protocol and departure from the camp, while he later criticised Townsend in a newspaper interview. But the Racing 92 number 10, one game away from his half century of Scotland outings, told the BBC last month: "Everything's better now with my relationship with Gregor." "The lockdown and time away from rugby and normal life allowed people to connect throughout the world and certainly we've connected a lot over that period and we want the best for him and the best for the Scotland team and we see them both coming together during this period," Townsend said. Another back in the fold is Glasgow Warriors lock Richie Gray, who in 2019 rejected the chance to join Scotland's World Cup training squad because of family reasons as he returned from injury. Scotland warm up against Georgia at Murrayfield on 23 October before completing their delayed Six Nations campaign in Wales eight days later. With a visit to Llanelli to come, Scotland sit third in the table following wins over France and Italy. Townsend's side then compete in the new Autumn Nations Cup in November with games away to Italy and at home to France and Fiji.
