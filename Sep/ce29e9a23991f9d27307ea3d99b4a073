Muchova broke Williams to start the match and deployed a wide variety of shotmaking including a pinpoint serve, a slice backhand and some well-timed trips to the net to frustrate the former world number one. Williams was sharper at the outset of the second set and served at 5-4 with the chance to extend the match to a third, but a backhand sailed on break point and Muchova leveled at 5-5. The 24-year-old Czech held at love the next game and sealed the win when Williams issued her third double fault on match point. “From the start I tried to be relaxed and get to my game but it was tough to get into a rhythm because we were having very short rallies,” said Muchova, who hit 27 winners and saved six of her eight break points. “I was happy I was able to turn it on in the end.” Williams was 21-0 in opening-round matches at the US Open coming into Tuesday but the seven-times Grand Slam champion was undone by 34 unforced errors at Arthur Ashe Stadium, where her sister Serena looked on from the largely empty stands. Despite the disappointment, the 40-year-old Williams, who turned professional at 14, said she was still passionate about the sport.
