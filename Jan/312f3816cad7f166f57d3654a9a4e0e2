Last October the UK government lifted an advisory against British flights to Sharmâ€™s airport which had been in place since 2015 when a Russian passenger jet was bombed, killing all 224 people on board shortly after take-off from the resort. EasyJet said on Wednesday that from June it will offer two flights a week from Manchester to Sharm, and from September, two flights a week from London Gatwick. --Reuters--
