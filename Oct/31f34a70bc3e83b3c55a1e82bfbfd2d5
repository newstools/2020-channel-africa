Fourteen perpetrators who were alleged to have carried out the attacks were also killed. This is the third round of attacks against civilians since September as ethnic-related unrest continues to be a challenge for the government. Problems remain even after military command posts were installed in parts of the state, following two rounds of attacks in September, in which dozens of people from the Amhara and Agew communities were killed. More than 40 government officials in the state were removed from their positions at the time, while 15 of them are still under investigation for negligence or possible involvement in the violence. Officials from the state said that one of the civilians killed in the latest attacks was a foreign national, but they did not specify the deceased’s country of origin. A year after winning the Nobel Peace Prize, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed’s administration continues to face ethnic unrest, particularly in the western part of the country in recent months. --BBC--
