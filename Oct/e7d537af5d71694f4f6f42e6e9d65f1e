The Bank of Uganda (BoU) noted a slight improvement in both foreign and domestic demand which, along with the easing of the lockdown and a stable exchange rate, are supporting economic growth recovery. But, the regulator warned that the “economic outlook is extremely uncertain”, largely due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The announcement of the central bank rate (CBR) on Thursday was delayed by nearly a week with banking industry insiders claiming the central bank’s Monetary Policy Committee meeting scheduled for last week had been postponed. Following the easing of restrictions for schools, churches, airlines, and border points, business activity has slightly picked up, raising hopes for traders hard hit by the containment measures of increased household spending. However, the central bank warned that inflation would remain above its five percent target until about 2022. --TheEastAfrican--
