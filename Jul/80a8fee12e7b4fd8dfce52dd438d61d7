SAFA President, Danny Jordaan said the season, suspended in March as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, could now come to a "fair conclusion". “I would like to thank the National Soccer League (NSL) chairperson and the entire board of governors for helping put this matter to rest," said Jordaan in a statement on the SAFA website. "We will now witness the ultimate and fair conclusion to the current and unique season and I am sure the football loving fans can’t wait for football to resume again." Jordaan said the Covid-19 pandemic had put soccer in the country to a definitive test but he was happy that most of those challenges were overcome. “The match officials are getting into peak fitness and come August 8, it will be all systems go,” concluded Jordaan. --News24--
