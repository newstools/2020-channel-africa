Playing his first Grand Slam singles match since the 2019 Australian Open, Murray produced an astonishing fightback from two sets down to defeat Japan’s Yoshihito Nishioka in four hours and 39 minutes in his opening round. But that match seemed to take a toll on the 33-year-old as he bowed out against Canadian Felix Auger-Aliassime in straight sets on Thursday. “The more tournaments that you play, the more matches that you play, you build up that sort of robustness in your body which right now I don’t really have,” Murray, who won his first Grand Slam title at Flushing Meadows in 2012, told reporters. “So that’s something that I’ll need to build up over the next few months and hopefully beginning of next year if I can stay healthy, I will be better able to back up difficult physical efforts.” The Scot arrived for the US Open tuneup at the Western & Southern Open having not played a professional match since the Davis Cup Finals in November 2020. Murray picked up back-to-back wins over Frances Tiafoe and world number seven Alexander Zverev but his level dropped against Milos Raonic in the round of 16 loss. “I felt like I played some good stuff at times, but it was quite up and down. I would like to play consistently better tennis,” he said.
