West Region Governor, Awa Fonka Augustine, told AP that a security post in Galim village was targeted leaving officers and civilians dead. In a separate attack a locally made bomb exploded in the English-speaking north-western town of Bamenda by suspected separatists who had vowed to disrupt International Women Day activities. The explosion did not kill anyone but created panic. Separatists from Cameroonâ€™s English speaking region have been fighting since 2017. They want to create an independent English-speaking state in the majority French-speaking country. The United Nations says the conflict has left more than 3 000 people dead. --BBC--
