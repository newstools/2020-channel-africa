The Archbishop, 90, was abducted alongside a traditional ruler of the Nso people. The two were heading to the regional capital of Kumbo, when they were abducted. The Bishop of Kumbo, George Nkuo, told the BBC that the Cardinal and the traditional ruler, Sehm Mbinglo, together with their entourage were abducted at Babessi area, in Ngoketungia division. Archbishop Tumi was escorting the traditional ruler, whose title is Fon, back to Kumbo after he had fled there months ago following the killing of his two sons by suspected separatists. Bishop Nkuo said a big group of local residents was heading to the separatists' camp on Friday morning where they suspect the Archbishop and the traditional ruler were being held. Anglophone separatists have been demanding an independent state, saying they do not want to be part of French-speaking Cameroon, triggering a conflict that has claimed many lives. --BBC--
