Lauda, Mercedes' non-executive chairman and three-time F1 World Champion, passed away in May during the week of the Monaco Grand Prix. But Lauda's legacy remains with the six-time double champs on a daily basis, and Hamilton revealed that it's a source of comfort for him to look back at the conversations they had. "I miss getting the texts. I miss sharing those videos, and I still have a lot of our conversations and every now and then I revisit it," Hamilton told Motorsport.com. "But again, without his support, I probably wouldn't have made the switch to come to this team. Without his support, I wouldn't still be with this team. I don't think this team would have had success without his support. "Going to the board, pushing and breaking their balls. That is what he was the best at. "But also being real with me. Being the bridge between… Toto [Wolff] was a racing driver and the board, who were not racing drivers, to have a real champion who understands, and empathises with how difficult it is to deliver weekend in weekend out, [and] when you make a mistake… "That is where he has been such a great, great pillar for me. So I miss him a lot." Before his switch to Mercedes in 2013, Hamilton says he remembers Lauda "saying certain things about me on the TV and not really having a great opinion of me".
