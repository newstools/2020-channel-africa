There has also been 57 new COVID-19 related bringing the total number of deaths to 14 80. To date, there has been a total of 38 531 recoveries. The Western Cape continues to be the epicentre of the virus in the country with 42 539 which is 60.7% of the total cases, followed far behind by Gauteng with 11 164, which is only 15.9% of the total cases. Meanwhile, a new app “Keep out COVID” created by online technology, Howler, will allow individuals to screen themselves for coronavirus  through their phones using the app. The app hopes to lessen the burden of the healthcare system by allowing individuals to screen themselves from the comfort of their homes. Howle Director, Steve Cuzen, says, “Seeing the pandemic that has hit the world, we saw an opportunity to adapt our technology solutions to help people that were going back to work and schools. It also allows organisations to take control of the COVID-19 situation and prevent the COVID-19 from arriving at their organisations.” Cuzen sought to ensure people about the safety of the app, which he says is 100% safe. “No one has access to anything other than the organisation itself. All the information that we collect get to be stored to our servers that are encrypted. There is no way that people can hack them.”
