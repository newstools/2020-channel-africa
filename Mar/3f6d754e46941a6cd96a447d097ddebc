He said the decision came after government was advised that the country faced "continued potential grave threats" despite having recorded only five confirmed cases of Covid-19 as of Thursday. In an address in Harare, Mnangagwa said all non-essential services were expected to completely cease operations for the next 21 days, while shops and food open markets would operate under the supervision of health officials. In addition to food markets, industries producing food, water and sanitary products would also be permitted to remain open. Mnangagwa said his government was working on ways to support businesses and the economy. As part of the restrictive measures, all public transport will be grounded, save for the state-owned Zimbabwe United Passenger Company (ZUPCO) and government workers' buses, who will observe social distancing and sanitation practices. "The new restrictive routines must be internalised by all of us, regardless of positions in society," said Mnangagwa. He said security forces would be deployed where there is non-compliance. --News24--
