The move is in line with a plan to protect textile industries that have been identified as strategic to the region. Part of the regional tax reforms will also see iron and steel, agro-processing, and wood and wood products imported into the region attract similar duty. The regional private sector businesses are demanding a 32.5 % duty on finished products to protect local industries. The proposal will be presented to the next East African Community Heads of State summit, scheduled for Arusha on February 29, for consideration. Under the EACâ€™s three-band tariff structure which came into effect on January 1, 2005, finished goods imported into the regional bloc attract a duty of 25 %, intermediate goods 10 %, and there is no duty on raw materials. Sensitive items such as sugar, wheat, rice and milk attract a higher duty of above 25 % to protect local industries from competition. The East African has learnt that as part of the review of the EAC Common External Tariff (CET), member states have agreed on a new tariff structure of four bands, but failed to agree on the rates to be imposed on goods in the new band. The new four-band tariff structure includes zero per cent import duty for raw materials and capital goods, 10 % import duty for intermediate products not available in the EAC, and 25 % import duty for intermediate products available in the region. However, partner states have disagreed on the rate for the highest band, which will be either 30 % or 35 % for finished products. --TheEastAfrican--
