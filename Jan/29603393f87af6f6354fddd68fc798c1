Speaking at a refugee centre in Rwanda, Joran Kallmyr said: “It is... important to give them the signal ‘don’t go to Libya if you want you your asylum assessed’ they have to do it here in Rwanda instead, don’t go to Libya because you’ll not come to Europe that way." Kallmyr was visiting the centre on Monday to re-affirm his country’s pledge to take in 600 refugees. He said Norway will carefully examine each case and will not take economic migrants but real refugees. Rwanda agreed to take 500 refugees from Libya and grant permanent residence to those who seek it. There are currently more than 3000 migrants stranded in Libya. Apart from Norway, Canada agreed to take 800, France 200, and Sweden 150 .
