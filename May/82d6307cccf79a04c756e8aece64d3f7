The 17-year-old has been at Fleetwood since 2014 after dazzling the scouts during a tournament in England. Soon afterwards, he signed for the club's academy and has not looked back since. "How I got to sign for Fleetwood town I actually got scouted while playing at a Lancashire youth tournament in England," he said, as quoted by FARpost. "We had a great run in that tournament and eventually won it and immediately Fleetwood signed me to join their youth academy.” He added: "I can actually play anywhere in the middle of the park I like to play a deep role protecting the defence. "I can also play at a more advanced role in midfield so I could say I’m a box-to-box midfielder actually.” Raffie has a South African father and an Australian mother and has confidently opted to play for Bafana Bafana if he makes the bar to play at national level one day, he has already trained with Fleetwood's first team. "Yes, my father is South African which makes me South African. I'm really connected to that part of my life and one day I want to play for South Africa," he said. "I've actually spent so much time with the U23s and the first team in the past 12 months so it's a good thing because I train with them every week. The coach believes in giving young players a chance hopefully my chance will come soon," he concluded. --News24--
