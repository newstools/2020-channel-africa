The countryâ€™s National Disaster Management Organisation (Nadmo) has dispatched a rescue team to assist residents of affected communities. The flooding was caused by torrential rains and the overspill of excess water from the Bagre dam in neighbouring Burkina Faso. As well as washing away homes, the water has also submerged a large area of cropland raising concerns about possible food shortages in the future. Nadmo officials say they are still assessing the extent of damage. A $93m dam is being built in northern Ghana to minimise the impact of the floods. A similar incident last year claimed over 30 lives. --BBC--
