Afrox, which listed in the JSE in 1963, said in a statement yesterday the proposal was made because Linde believed the local group was more suitable for an unlisted environment, as Afroxâ€™s low share liquidity deterred potential investors and its listing provided little benefit to shareholders. Linde also aimed to improve integration among the Afrox operations with other Linde group operations Edward, which could be more easily done in an unlisted environment. Linde had already received support from Afrox shareholders who hold about 63.5 % of the shares. --IOL--
