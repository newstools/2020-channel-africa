The move is likely to fuel unrest as the country tries to attract foreign investment to exploit its mineral wealth. Guineans vote on Sunday in a referendum on constitutional reforms that could allow Conde to stand again, and the prospect of him staying longer in office has already led to months of sometimes violent protests. His opponents believe that Conde, who became Guinea’s first democratically elected leader in 2010, is becoming increasingly authoritarian and will follow other African leaders who have extended their rule through political machinations. Conde told le Figaro newspaper that the 2010 constitution was bad and needed modernizing. “The Guinean people will ask this question: Is it the first time that a president changes the constitution to do a third or fourth term? Why would it be impossible in Guinea to do three mandates?” he said in an interview published on Wednesday. In some other African countries, leaders have used a constitution change as an excuse to reset their term limits. “It’s only Guinea that is criticized. Some countries can change constitution four or five times without being criticized,” Conde said, using Chadian President Idriss Deby as an example.
