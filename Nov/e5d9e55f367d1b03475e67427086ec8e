There has been concern that a humanitarian disaster is unfolding. In a message from Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's office, the government says that it is supporting those in need in Tigray and will set up camps to receive those who have fled. The government will also open up what is described as a "humanitarian access route". The statement said that the authorities are "committed to work with UN agencies and other organisations". --BBC--
