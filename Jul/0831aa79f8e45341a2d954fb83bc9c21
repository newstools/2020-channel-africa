“We are close, very close to a deal,” he was quoted as saying by a local newspaper. As per the deal, both countries would start getting benefits from the resources of natural gas in the Mediterranean Sea. In July 2020, President Abdel Fattah El Sisi met Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Dendias, discussing the enhancement of the bilateral relations on all levels, according to a statement from the Egyptian Presidency. In July 2029, Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry met with Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Dendias in Athens, discussing the importance of maximising the benefit of the new discoveries of natural gas in the eastern Mediterranean in light of the great potential available for the benefit of the region’s peoples, especially in light of the outcomes of the second ministerial meeting of the Eastern Mediterranean Natural Gas Forum, held recently in Cairo. In 2013, Egypt signed an agreement to demarcate the maritime borders with Cyprus and the deal was opposed by Turkey. --EgyptToday--
