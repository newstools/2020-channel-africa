Hundreds of protesters spent the night on the streets after holding a march on Tuesday. An alliance of opposition and religious leaders is spearheading the protests against economic decline, alleged government corruption and a long-running jihadist conflict. Regional efforts to bring an end to the crisis have failed, with the opposition refusing to compromise on their demand that the president resigns.
