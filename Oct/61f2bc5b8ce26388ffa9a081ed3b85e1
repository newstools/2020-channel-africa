The semi-autonomous archipelago is due to hold elections on Wednesday, although early voting has started for electoral officials and the police. Zanzibar has a history of contested polls. The opposition had claimed that three people were killed in Pemba island and several others injured as police used live ammunition to disperse a crowd. But Mr Sirro has told journalists that police only arrested 42 youths in connection to the violence in Pemba. He said the youths had thrown stones at police officers and electoral officials who were distributing voting kits ahead of the elections. He added that police will not allow people to stay at polling stations after voting.Â
