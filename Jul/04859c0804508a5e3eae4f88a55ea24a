“I really want to thank the coach for showing me that trust,” said the 18-year-old who came on as a substitute. His is a remarkable story. Juwara arrived in the Italian island of Sicily in 2016 on a migrant boat as an unaccompanied minor, then aged 14. “I’m really happy to score my first goal, which I want to dedicate to my family and all those who have helped me on my journey. This is a dream for me and a day I’ll remember for the rest of my life,” Reuters news agency quotes Juwara as saying after Sunday's win. His compatriot, Musa Barrow, scored the other goal as the 10-man visitors claimed an unlikely 2-1 win over Inter Milan. --BBC--
