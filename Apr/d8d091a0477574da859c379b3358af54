Johnson has been receiving treatment for coronavirus at St Thomas' Hospital in London since Sunday. No 10 said he "has been moved this evening from intensive care back to the ward, where he will receive close monitoring during the early phase of his recovery". A spokesperson added: "He is in extremely good spirits." He was taken to hospital on Sunday, 10 days after testing positive, and was moved to intensive care on Monday. Johnson received "standard oxygen treatment" in intensive care and was not put on a ventilator, Downing Street said earlier. He "continues to improve" after a "good night" and thanked the NHS for the "brilliant care" he has received, the spokesman added. United States President, Donald Trump, tweeted that Johnson's move out of intensive care was "great news".
