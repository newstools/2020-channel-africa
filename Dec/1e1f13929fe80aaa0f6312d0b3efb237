BBC Monitoring observed that the national broadcaster ETV reported for the first time from Mekelle on Wednesday and spoke to residents who described the atmosphere as "peaceful". "Residents have said Mekelle is back to its peaceful life after the defence army entered the town to enforce law and order. The residents said they would work together with security forces for sustainable peace in the town," the TV report said. Meanwhile Tigray TV, which was based in Mekelle before it fell to federal forces, has continued to broadcast intermittently, breaking news on "fighting" that it says has continued "on all fronts". It is currently broadcasting from an unknown location. During the bulletin at 1900 local time on Wednesday, a man in military fatigues read a statement he said was issued by the "Tigray regional government" and a breaking news item that the "Tigray Defence Forces destroyed 11 enemy tanks" on Tuesday. --BBC--
