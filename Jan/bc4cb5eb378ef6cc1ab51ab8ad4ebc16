Marry Mubaiwa, 38, who is the wife of Vice President Constantino Chiwenga, 63, was arrested last month on allegations of attempted murder, fraud and contravening the country's exchange control laws by transfering about $1m abroad. The High Court in Harare freed her on a $2.780 bail and she was ordered to surrender her diplomatic passport. She also offered title deeds of her father's house as surety. The businesswoman and former model who was previously married to a national football player, will report to the police twice weekly. A trial date has not been set yet but she is due back in court on January 14 for a routine pre-trial appearance. The attempted murder charges arose from a trip last year when she accompanied her husband who was airlifted for medical attention to South Africa. In Pretoria she allegedly took the ailing Chiwenga to a hotel, refusing to take him to hospital until his aides forced their way and took him to a clinic. Prosecutors alleged that "with intent to cause serious harm", Mubaiwa went to Chiwenga's hospital ward and asked his security aides to leave saying she wanted to have a private conversation with her husband. Alone with the bedridden Chiwenga, Mubaiwa allegedly removed an intravenous line and a catheter from her husband causing him to bleed profusely, the prosecution said.Â
