Citi equity strategists are recommending clients play it safe by holding United States (US) stocks and healthcare shares and reducing exposure to bank shares, as earnings are likely to take a while to recover from the coronavirus fallout. “The bullish push from $6 trillion of global quantitative easing is likely to cancel out the bearish drag from the on-going lockdown,” the investment bank’s equity strategists said in a note published late on Sunday. Restrictive measures imposed to contain the virus has ravaged economic activity and hurt demand for risky assets in recent months, but their impact has been offset somewhat by huge asset buying from central banks, which has supported confidence. “We would not chase markets higher from current levels,” the strategists said. The note forecasts the S&P 500 to be at 3160 points in mid-2021, about 1% higher than Friday's close. It expects other major markets from Australia to Europe and Japan. --Reuters--
