USOPC Chief Executive, Sarah Hirshland, said the centres at Colorado Springs and Lake Placid would welcome small groups of athletes from June 26.Â 

"We will start small, we will start slowly, and we will scale up as we feel confident in our systems and in our safety protocols in those two locations," Hirshland told reporters. Hirshland warned, meanwhile, that the USOPC had already drawn up a contingency plan should next year's Tokyo Olympics, which were postponed from 2020, not take place. "It will require additional and significant financial cuts to the organisation," Hirshland warned. "We are preparing for that scenario and putting ourselves in a position to be able to weather that incredibly unfortunate storm if it were to happen." The USOPC has already been hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic, laying off 51 staff and furloughing 33 employees in a bid to slash overheads by 12.5%. On the issue of athlete protests, meanwhile, Hirshland said the USOPC was still in the process of formulating a policy in consultation with athletes. The USOPC faced criticism after reprimanding hammer thrower Gwen Berry and fencer Race Imboden at last year's Pan-American Games in Lima. "We are 100% clear on our commitment to racial equality, equality overall and broad-based inclusion," Hirshland said.
