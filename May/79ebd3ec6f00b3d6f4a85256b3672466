The returnees are coming back home amid rising numbers of Covid-19 positive cases which have now reached 149 after 17 more people tested positive yesterday. The cumulative number of tests done is now 40 847 with 28 recoveries and four deaths. Foreign Affairs and International Trade Minister, Sibusiso Moyo, said Zimbabwe’s embassy in Namibia was liaising with the Namibian Government to organise the return home of the Zimbabweans. “There are 182 Zimbabweans in the ship and it was meant to be docking on Wednesday or Thursday. “The owners are from the United States and are pursuing options to get them here,” Minister Moyo said. Earlier at State House President Mnangagwa had acknowledged the presence of the Zimbabweans on the ship while receiving donations from several organisations to help fight the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. The President said the returning citizens would be welcomed home but would all have to undergo quarantine and testing measures recommended by the World Health Organisation, before they finally joined their families. Zimbabwean citizens residing or working in various places across the world are returning following the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic and the subsequent lockdowns. --Herald--
