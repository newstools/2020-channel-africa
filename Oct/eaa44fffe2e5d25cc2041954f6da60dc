European shares 2.8% to their lowest since late May as Germany and France prepared to announce restrictions approaching the level of last spring's lockdowns, as COVID-19 deaths across Europe rose almost 40% in a week. French shares were among the hardest hit, losing 3.2% to a five-month low. Investors were rattled by a media report that France might impose a national lockdown from midnight on Thursday. In Frankfurt, German stocks slumped 3.1% to their lowest since June. Chancellor Angela Merkel was due to meet state premiers to discuss closing restaurants and bars and allowing people to go out in public only with members of their own household. The gloomy news pummeled stocks seen as especially sensitive to the economy. Automakers .SXAP and banks .SX7P led the losses, falling 3.9% and 2.1% respectively. Concerns over a second wave of infections played out in currency and bond markets, too, with the euro slumping 0.6% against the dollar to $1.1736. German government bond yields fell to their lowest since March. Wall Street futures pointed to losses for US stocks of 1.1% to 1.8%.
