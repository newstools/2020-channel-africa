The inquiry has been investigating allegations of state capture, corruption and fraud since August 2018. On Tuesday it turned its attention to the SABC. Yunus Carrim, the former Minister of Communications, Telecommunications and Postal Services, told the inquiry a 2013 contract between the SABC and MultiChoice not only entrenched the pay-TV operator's monopoly, but also undermined government's objective of bridging the divide between the rich and poor. According to Carrim, the public broadcaster agreed to MultiChoice's position to not encrypt set-top boxes during a migration from analogue to digital. MultiChoice, he said, had been opposed to the set-top boxes, with the support of some executives at the SABC, allegedly including former board chair Mbulaheni Maguvhe and ex-COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng in what he referred as "regulatory policy capture." "There has been a lot of evidence before this commission which looked at the capture of state organs, but here were were dealing with the capture of regulatory policy," he said. Reached for comment earlier on Tuesday, a media liaison for MultiChoice said the group would comment on the evidence once it has been completed. But in an earlier internal message to staff, MultiChoice CEO Calvo Mawela instructed staff to "not be distracted" by allegations which may be aired at the state capture inquiry.
