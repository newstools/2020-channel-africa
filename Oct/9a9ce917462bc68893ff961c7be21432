Inter said in a statement that the Englishman, who plays as a full back or winger, was in quarantine at home. Midfielders Roberto Gagliardini and Radja Nainggolan also returned positive results from tests carried out at Interâ€™s training ground this week. Defenders Alessandro Bastoni and Milan Skriniar tested positive while with Italy under-21 and Slovakia senior squads, respectively. Under Serie A rules, players who test positive have to quarantine for 14 days, which could leave Inter seriously depleted for their derby against AC Milan on October 17. --Reuters--
