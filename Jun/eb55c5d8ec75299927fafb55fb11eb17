Cross-border drivers have faced anger from people across East Africa who believe they are spreading the virus. Nine out of 10 Covid-19 cases in Uganda are lorry drivers. In recent weeks countries in East Africa have been under pressure to close their borders to trucks, but the transport of vital goods, like food and medicine, has continued. Drivers crossing the Kenya-Uganda border are tested for the virus and that process has led to long delays for lorries, with traffic jams stretching for many kilometres. The virus is also now spreading in South Sudan. Some 280 drivers carrying freight from Uganda to Juba have contracted Covid-19 - half of them Ugandans. President Museveni has accused truckers of carrying passengers in South Sudan and so spreading the virus. The transport drivers say they are intercepted by armed South Sudanese, after they cross the border, and are forced to take unwanted passengers to Juba. The lorry drivers say they are already stigmatised, over public fears they are spreading coronavirus and President Museveni's claim that they willingly carry passengers makes that situation worse. --BBC--
