Some 3 700 people are on board the Diamond Princess, which is quarantined in Yokohama for at least two weeks. The checks began after an 80-year-old Hong Kong man who had been on the ship last month fell ill with the virus. He boarded the luxury cruise liner in Yokohama on 20 January and disembarked in Hong Kong on 25 January. A separate cruise ship, the World Dream, has been quarantined in Hong Kong after eight former passengers caught the virus. It has around 3 600 people on board, but none have tested positive so far. A British-American owned liner, the Westerdam, has been turned away by Japan even though it has not reported any cases of the virus. The new cases on board the Diamond Princess bring Japan's number of confirmed cases to 86, the second highest figure after China. "Today they will be sent to hospitals in several prefectures, and we are now preparing for that," Japan's Health Minister, Katsunobu Kato, said. One of those tested positive and now moved off board is Briton Alan Steel, who was on honeymoon with his wife, Wendy. With the quarantine due to last until 19 February, there has also been concern over supplies of normal medicine to the ship. One passenger has been waving a Japanese flag with the message "shortage of medicine". A Japanese TV crew on the shore responded with a banner asking: "What medicine?" In total, the roughly 2 700 passengers and 1 000 crew come from 56 countries. Around half the guests are from Japan, the tour company said, while the United Kingdom (UK) Government said there were 78 British citizens on board. The company said it was providing satellite TV, films, newspapers, room service, and free phone calls and internet to all guests. --BBC--
