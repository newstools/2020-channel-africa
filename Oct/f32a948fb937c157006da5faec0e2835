The two companies' vaccine is going through the first stages of testing. There is no internationally approved treatment for Covid-19, which has killed more than 1.16 million people. Meanwhile, GSK said it expects 2020 earnings to be at the lower end of forecasts, because Covid has disrupted vaccinations for other diseases. GSK and Sanofi will supply their vaccine candidate to the Covax scheme, which is backed by the World Health Organization (WHO). Covax, which aims to deliver two billion vaccine doses around the world by the end of 2021, has already signed agreements in 2020 with AstraZeneca and Novavax.  

It aims to discourage national governments from hoarding Covid-19 vaccines and to focus on vaccinating high-risk people first in every country. More than 180 nations, including China, have joined the plan, but some, including the US, have opted to stick with their own supply deals. Sanofi and GSK signed a $2.1 billion deal with Washington during the summer to supply it with more than 100 million doses of the same vaccine, which they hope to present for regulatory approval in 2021.
