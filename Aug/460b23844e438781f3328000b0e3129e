Churches will resume services on Sunday. All places of worship were closed in March because of the coronavirus pandemic. Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu said the reopening was a sign of progress in Nigeria's fight against the disease. But the places of worship are only allowed to hold 50% of their full capacity. Worshippers must also adhere to safety measures like wearing of face masks and social distancing.
