The youngest son of Afrobeat legend Fela Kuti said the party was established in opposition to the country’s elites. Kuti has claimed the police threatened to close his family’s nightclub, The New Afrika Shrine in Lagos, if he held a meeting of his movement there. There were local media reports of a heavy police presence around the venue on Tuesday morning. In a small conference broadcast live on social media, Kuti explained that the Movement of the People (MOP) was a coalition of socialist, progressive organisations. Representatives of the factions also spoke at the meeting. The original Movement of the People was set up by Fela in 1979. He intended to run for the presidency under its banner but was barred from taking part. The revival of the MOP was announced as a young Nigerian man involved in recent protests against police brutality was released on bail. Twenty-seven-year-old musician Eromosele Adene was detained on 7 November. His lawyers say there was no charge made against him. His supporters have claimed he was detained for his involvement in the #EndSARS protests. Other protesters have had their accounts frozen without warning. The central bank has listed potential involvement in terrorism as a reason for the action. The rights group Human Rights Watch has described the move as a "gross abuse of power". --BBC--
