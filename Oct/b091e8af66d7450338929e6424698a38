Ethnic-related unrest continues to be a challenge for the government. Only last week at least 31 civilians were killed by unknown militants in southern Ethiopia. "I would like to strongly urge the government to take precautionary measures against such attacks," Teddy wrote in a Facebook post. Teddy enjoys an almost cult-like following in Ethiopia. He is no stranger to controversy though. He raised the ire of the authorities in 2005 when he released an album that was seen as critical of the authorities in the wake of disputed elections. His music was the anthem of the anti-government protesters. Algerian President transferred to Germany for 'checkups' The Algerian President, Abdelmajid Tebboune, has been transferred to Germany for what state TV says are "medical checkups". Tebboune had been admitted to hospital in Algeria on Tuesday. The nature of his condition has not been revealed, but there has been speculation that he's been infected by the coronavirus. On Saturday, Tebboune went into five days of voluntary self -isolation at the advice of his doctors after many of his aides and government figures tested positive for coronavirus. Tebboune's hospitalisation has come just days before a referendum on proposed changes to Algeria's constitution, which the president very much wants to see approved. --BBC--
