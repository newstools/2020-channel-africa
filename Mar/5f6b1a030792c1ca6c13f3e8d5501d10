A closure of schools and universities, which were shut on March 14 for two weeks, will be extended for a further two weeks, Prime Minster Mostafa Madbouly said. Most public services and government offices will close their doors to the public during the curfew period and a measure to limit the number of government employees going to work will be prolonged until mid-April. The government has also allocated $63.69 million to the health ministry to help it provide supplies, a statement from the cabinet office said. Egypt has confirmed 366 cases of coronavirus, including 19 deaths. It has taken a series of measures to prevent the spread of the illness, including ordering all cafes, shopping malls, sports clubs and nightclubs to shut from 7 pm until 6 am since March 19. It has also grounded commercial flights and shut mosques and churches.
