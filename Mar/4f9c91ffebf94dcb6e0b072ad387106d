Other large United States (US) retail banks like JPMorgan Chase & Co and Citigroup have sent similar reminders to customers about their digital banking capabilities in March. “We strongly encourage you to use Capital One’s digital tools and other resources for self-service banking and 24/7 account access,” Captial One Financial Corp wrote to customers in an email adding that representatives were always available. “We want to make sure our clients know they can bank, invest, and make payments from wherever they are, particularly if they’re not able to come to a branch,” a Chase spokesperson said in a statement. Mounting fears about the quickly spreading coronavirus has prompted many Americans to work from home and avoid public spaces as local officials encourage social distancing. The pandemic has also driven many corporate meetings to virtual settings to reduce human contact. As of Thursday, there were more than 126 000 cases of coronavirus globally and more than 4 600 people have died, according to a Reuters tally. --Reuters--
