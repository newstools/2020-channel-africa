A health ministry spokesperson Rashid Aman said self-isolation was one of the recommendations by the World Health Organization, but added that health workers will keep a close eye on recent arrivals through regular phone calls and visits. Criticism has increased after the Kenyan government allowed the first direct flight from China in two weeks. The 239 passengers who landed on that China Southern Airlines flight at Nairobi's main airport on Wednesday have been asked to self-isolate for 14 days. Ethiopian and China Southern Airlines are the only carriers operating flights between Kenya and China. Kenyan newspaper headlines expressed outrage at the ministers for security, foreign affairs, transport and health for, they say, risking the lives of millions of Kenyans.
