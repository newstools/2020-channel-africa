Elliott held more than $1 billion worth of shares in Hyundai Motor (005380.KS), Kia Motors (000270.KS) and Hyundai Mobis (012330.KS), an Elliott unit said in April 2018.  

But it was not on the December 2019 year-end list of shareholders in any of the companies, the Korea Economic Daily reported, citing an unidentified investment banking source. An Elliott spokesman could not be immediately reached. 

Hyundai Motor declined to comment, saying that the company is not able to disclose detailed shareholder information.   

A recent recovery in Hyundai share prices may have influenced the move, the newspaper said, citing the source. Hyundai Motor shares, which at end-March 2018 were at 143.500 won per share, dipped as low as 92.500 won in November 2018 before recovering to 122.500 won near end-December 2019.
