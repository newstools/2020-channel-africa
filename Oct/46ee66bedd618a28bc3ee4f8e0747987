In a statement, the park offered its condolences to the family of Bagurubumwe Chuhoze Deogene, 47, following his killing on Saturday by gunmen suspected to be from the FDLR-RUD rebel group. The gunmen also pillaged nearby villages, the statement added. Virunga National Park is Africa's oldest nature reserve. It is popular with tourists who visit its mountain gorillas. The biologically diverse park is a Unesco World Heritage Site in the restive east of the DRC. At least 12 rangers were killed in the park in April by suspected rebels who operate in the region. In 2018, park ranger Rachel Masika Baraka was killed during the brief kidnapping of two British tourists and their driver. --BBC--
