Linde finished on a total of 325.337 points, a handful of points ahead of Dolphins duo, all-rounder, Prenelan Subrayen (306.297) and wicketkeeper-batsman, Grant Roelofsen (302.650). The SACA MVP rankings measure the overall performances of players in domestic franchise cricket across all three CSA domestic franchise competitions - the 4-Day competition and the One-Day Cup. Players earn points based on an internationally recognised formula, used by many player associations around the world, for batting, bowling, fielding and a players contribution to matches won by the team. The points are weighted across CSA's domestic franchise competitions, to ensure that critical performances are recognised in each match. The SACA MVP rankings also identify those players who have performed outstandingly in particular competitions with overall points broken down into batting, bowling and fielding indices. "It's a great feeling finishing top of the SACA MVP for the season," said Linde. "It was a short, but great season for me this year and I am looking forward to next season."
