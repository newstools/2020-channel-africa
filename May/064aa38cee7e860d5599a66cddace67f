The government confirmed on Thursday that a May 12 letter from the foreign ministry was sent to WHO country head Walter Kazadi Mulombo and three others of the United Nations (UN) body’s health experts, ordering them out by Friday. The vote for a successor to President Pierre Nkurunziza, whose government has been repeatedly accused of rights abuses and has previously expelled other representatives of international bodies, is due on May 20. Bernard Ntahiraja, the Foreign Affairs Assistant Minister, confirmed the WHO officials had been declared “persona non grata” but did not give reasons. The head of a regional disease control body, John Nkengasong, called the expulsions “unfortunate” and criticised the decision to hold elections during a health crisis. “We have to collectively deny the virus any space to transmit,” said Nkengasong, head of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention which is a branch of the African Union bloc. “It will be extremely difficult for the country to overcome the virus. Cases have increased in countries that went ahead and held elections,” he added at a news conference in Ethiopia. During Burundi’s election campaign, large crowds have been gathering despite strict lockdowns and social-distance rules elsewhere in Africa and around the world.
