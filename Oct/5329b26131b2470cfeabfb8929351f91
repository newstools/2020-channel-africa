In a statement, Spokesperson for the Health Ministry Khaled Megahed said 11 patients have died from the virus over the past 24 hours, raising the death toll to 5981.

As many as 81 patients were discharged from isolation hospitals after receiving necessary medical care, taking the number of recovered cases to 97 355 so far, the Megahed said. Russia's Sovereign Wealth Fund said on September 30 that it had agreed to supply 25 million doses of its potential COVID-19 vaccine to Egypt through Pharco, considered as one of Egypt's leading pharmaceutical groups. The Russian Direct Investment Fund has concluded several deals to supply the Sputnik-V vaccine abroad, including the supply of 100 million doses to India, where it is also expected to conduct clinical trials. Also, Egypt has carried out the third phase of its first clinical trial of two Chinese coronavirus vaccines. The Ministry of Health announced “promising results” and that the vaccine is set to be available for the public after its effectiveness is fully confirmed. Noha Assem, adviser to the Minister of Health for research affairs, said in TV statements that the ultimate goal behind the volunteer participation in these clinical trials is “science and humanity.” She added that the study responds to a specific research question, in addition to measuring the degree of vaccine safety. She further mentioned some conditions for volunteering to undergo the clinical trials, which include that citizens should be under the age of 18, and did not contract diseases that are difficult to cure. The ministry is carrying out medical analysis to volunteers to make sure it is safe for them to be vaccinated.  --EgyptToday--
