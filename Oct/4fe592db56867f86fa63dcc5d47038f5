South African officials are reportedly concerned over player welfare and their limited preparation time. The Springboks have not played since beating England in the World Cup final in Japan last November. The six-week championship, which begins on October 31, will be held entirely in Australia because of the pandemic. Tournament organiser, Sanzaar (South Africa, New Zealand, Australia and Argentina Rugby), has given the world champions another 48 hours to agree participation. South Africa was due to arrive in Australia this weekend, before their opening fixture against Argentina on November 7 in Brisbane, with all travelling squads having to quarantine for two weeks on arrival. Sanzaar has already been forced to move the Australia vs New Zealand Test on December 12 forward to October 31, to avoid All Blacks players being in two-week quarantine at Christmas after returning to New Zealand. --BBC--
