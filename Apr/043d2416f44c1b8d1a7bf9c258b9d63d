UEFA's executive committee is expected to set out on Thursday how teams might qualify for next season's European competitions if domestic leagues and cups are cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic. European football's governing body had said earlier this month that clubs' places in the Champions League and Europa League could be jeopardised if competitions were ended prematurely but softened its stance after a national association meeting earlier this week. It is still UEFA's "strong recommendation" that national association do everything possible to finish the 2019/20 season, but now says it will consider "special cases" and its executive committee is poised to set out the protocols for how teams may qualify. They may opt to adopt a points-per-game approach to decide who should qualify from cancelled league competitions, while national associations may be able to submit their own suggestions to UEFA for deciding entrants from cup competitions. Once the guidelines are set, it may prompt the Scottish Professional Football League to consult with Premiership clubs over ending the campaign. The lower divisions in Scotland have already curtailed their seasons. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has sounded a very cautious note on the subject of sport returning any time soon, even behind closed doors. Belgium is close to confirming the cancellation of the Pro League season, while the decision of the Dutch Government to extend a ban on major events taking place until September 1 looks set to mean the Eredivisie will also be forced to end its campaign. A fixture working group is still looking at calendar options and is committed to outlining its plans no later than mid-May. The hope is to complete domestic leagues and cups in June and July, leaving August clear to finish off the 2019-20 Champions League and Europa League.
