Markets started to trade on the prospect of a Biden presidency and a Republican-controlled US Senate last week, but the Democratic candidate's projected victory on Saturday gave more fuel to the move. The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 49 countries, rose 0.5% to a record high in early European hours. On Friday, it posted its biggest one-week gain in nearly seven months. E-mini futures for the S&P 500 jumped more than 1.4% on Monday. Nasdaq futures rallied more than 2% to just under a record high, signalling a positive start for US markets. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia Pacific shares outside of Japan jumped 1.3% after hitting its highest since January 2018. The pan-Europe climbed 1.5% to one-month highs by 0846 GMT. “Why the excitement? Hopes of less diplomatic and trade angst, a lower Dollar helps global rebalancing,” Chris Bailey, European strategist at Raymond James in London said in a note. “A lot of hope, but over two months until inauguration day!” --Reuters--
