The Harambee Stars are placed second on the Group G standings after draws with Egypt and Togo, while Les Coelacantes are the surprise leaders with four points. The teams will meet first in Nairobi on November 11, before the return game in Moroni four days later. “We’ve had a good start in this competition and the matches have now reached a crucial stage,” Onyango is quoted by Kenya's Nation. “The ideal situation is to win our remaining home matches to improve on our chances (of qualification). A win against Comoros is also key because we get to move above them.” Onyango, who has recently secured a transfer to South African heavyweights Mamelodi Sundowns, is expected to start in central defence alongside Sweden-based Joseph Okumu. The matches against Comoros will be the first in the latest tenure of Jacob ‘Ghost’ Mulee, who was named Kenya coach for the fifth time in October. The Harambee Stars are looking to qualify for a seventh AFCON finals and a second in a row, having ended a 15-year absence from the tournament at the 2019 edition.  --AllAfrica--
