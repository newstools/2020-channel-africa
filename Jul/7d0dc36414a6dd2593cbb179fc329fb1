The International Organization for Migration (IOM) says the authorities have caused at least 14,500 Ethiopian migrants to become stranded in Yemen without access to basic services like health care and clean water. With the country's borders blocked because of the coronavirus pandemic, IOM says the migrants are being forcibly transferred to regions in Aden, Marib, Lahj and Saâ€™ada - where they are now stranded and face difficulties. The organisation says migrants are "scapegoated" as carriers of the virus and suffer exclusion and violence. "As a reaction to the Covid-19 pandemic, migrants in Yemen have been experiencing verbal and physical harassment, increased detention, movement restrictions as well as forced movements to areas far from main urban centres or services." Thousands of Ethiopians cross to Yemen each year in search of economic opportunities but Covid-restrictions have made it worse this year. Last year, IOM says 138,000 migrants arrived in Yemen from the Horn of Africa, predominantly from Ethiopia, hoping to eventually make it to Saudi Arabia. --BBC--
