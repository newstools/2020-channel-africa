The union says the plan was confirmed on Tuesday during a meeting between SAA unions and Public Enterprises Minister, Pravin Gordhan. In terms of the agreement, government will source $11 million funding for severance packages. The decision will result in the termination of all SAA employees' contracts. However, current SAA staff will be given preference for employment in the new airline. NTM President, Mashudu Raphetha, says itâ€™ is a very sad day for the whole of the republic that SAA is now going to shut down, resulting in the emergence of a new airline. Meanwhile, the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA) and the South African Cabin Crew Association (SACCA) didn't want to be drawn on the decision to close down SAA. However, the unions confirmed that negotiations with government on the future of SAA are progressing well. News on SAA come on the back of developments on Tuesday that trade unions said they were studying the SA Express judgement and will respond soon. The airline was placed under provisional liquidation after the Johannesburg High Court heard its case. The Business Rescue Practitioners of SA Express last month filed an urgent application to the High Court to have the airline liquidated. The practitioners say government withheld financial support and failed to provide post-commencement funding for them to do their work.
