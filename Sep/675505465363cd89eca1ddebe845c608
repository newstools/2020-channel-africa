The Southern African nation suspended flights and shut its borders in March as it sought to curb the spread of the coronavirus, which has infected 7 388 people and resulted in 218 deaths. The government said in a statement that domestic flights would resume on September 10, while international flights would start on October 1. “All travellers will be required to have a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) COVID-19 clearance certificate issued by a recognised facility within 48 hours from the date of departure,” the statement said. A COVID-19 lockdown has until now closed all tourist attractions, forcing some hotels and resorts to lay off workers. The government expects the tourism sector to contract 7.4% this year. --Reuters--
