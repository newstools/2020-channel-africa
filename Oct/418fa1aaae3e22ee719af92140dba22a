The army said the request was made after Lagos Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, had imposed a state-wide 24-hour curfew on October 20. The governor last week accused "powers beyond his control" of shooting at protesters. He later said CCTV footage showed army personnel at Lekki toll gate, the scene of one of the shootings. Rights group, Amnesty International, said at least 12 people were killed in two incidents in Lagos that day. The army continues to deny involvement in the shooting. It said there “is no iota of truth” in any allegations that soldiers opened fire on civilians. --BBC--
