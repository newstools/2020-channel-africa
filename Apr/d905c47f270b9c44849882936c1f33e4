Somalia is woefully unprepared for a surge in cases. Its healthcare system has been shattered by three decades of conflict. Many hospitals lack regular electricity supplies, let alone equipment. Only about half the population of urban dwellers have access to medical care, the figure drops to 15% for rural areas. Doctors say people are dying across the country. Many Somalis will find it impossible to practise prevention measures as they live in overcrowded camps, with no access to clean water or soap. There are reports that, in some areas, gravediggers are unable to cope with the number of dead. The International Committee of the Red Cross's health co-ordinator for Somalia said there would be a large number of new cases in the coming week. --BBC--
