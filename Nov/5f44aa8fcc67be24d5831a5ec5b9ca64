“The local economic slump, exacerbated by Covid-19 has left local businesses overcommitted on floor space,” says Andrew Robinson co-founder & executive director of SiSebenza. “Companies are increasingly moving to remote working or distributed working models, meaning that they’re downsizing, moving out of, or breaking up, their existing office spaces.” Office Hub’s advanced tenant search platform uses machine learning to match and connect companies looking for short term furnished space to flexi providers and private companies who have excess space that they want to rent out. The Office Hub marketplace is a world first as it delivers a seamless experience for the flexi industry to list real-time inventory, whilst producing advanced data analytics on the supply and demand for flexi space and an integrated CRM system, MyOfficeHub. Office Hub’s sophisticated AI-based technology is backed by a team of property specialists who support every enquiry with expert advice to help with shortlisting spaces, organising tours and negotiating the best deal for both the tenant and workspace owner. The combination of cutting-edge tech and real-life teams delivers an “Uber-like” customer journey from the moment a search commences to the day a tenant moves in. “Beyond being the smartest proptech in the world, our faith remains firmly in the magic of human connection and hard-earned know-how. In partnership with SiSebenza, the South African leader in the flexible workspace market, we have created a best-of-breed experience to deliver an unmatched and personal process,” says Office Hub founder and CEO Grant Philipp. With the South Africa Property Owners Association (Sapoa) reporting that in the quarter to end-June 2020, South Africa’s national office vacancy was at a 16-year high of 12.3% and A-grade office rentals 2.8% down year-on-year, local landlords are in desperate need of finding effective and efficient ways to fill their spaces. --IOL--
