After a summer lull in much of Europe, the infection rate has begun to rise sharply, with a number of countries including Britain introducing tougher rules to help limit the spread of the virus. Fears that a market rebound in recent months had gone too far held stocks back, although positive German and French business sentiment data helped pare European losses slightly as did US stock futures pointing to a flat open. The MSCI World index was down 0.5% at 1018 GMT, its fifth day in the red out of the last six and hovering near a two-month low. A broad gauge of Europe's top shares, the STOXX Europe 600 .STOXX, was down 0.4%. S&P 500 futures ESc1 were flat nearing midday, holding steady after falls in the prior session after economic warnings from US Federal Reserve officials. That had, in turn, helped tee up weakness overnight in Asia with Asia Pacific shares outside Japan down by 1.99% to chalk up their worst day in two months. --Reuters--
