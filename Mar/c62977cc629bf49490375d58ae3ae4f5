Earlier in March, Italy banned travel within the country and ordered a freeze on all business activities deemed non-essential, including the car industry, until April 3 to curb the spread of coronavirus. FCA informed unions last week that if the government gave it the go-ahead, the automaker would be ready to resume some of its operations on April 6, Gianluca Ficco, a representative for metal workers union UILM, said. The sites concerned would be the assembly line for the Jeep Compass in Melfi in southern Italy, Atessa’s plant making light commercial vehicles in central Italy and preparatory operations for the new electric 500 in Turin’s Mirafiori factory, he said. A spokesperson for FCA confirmed that for now, the plan was to resume those three lines next week. However, Ficco said he did not know whether the government would allow non-essential activities to restart then and thought Rome was more likely to extend the ban. --Reuters—
