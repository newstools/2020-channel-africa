Iran has the highest number of deaths from coronavirus outside China, where the virus emerged late in 2019. “Among those who had been suspected of the virus, 35 have been confirmed and two died of the coronavirus infection,” said Health Ministry spokesperson Kianoush Jahanpour.  

He said 95 people had been infected across Iran. The Health Ministry urged Iranians to stay at home. Iran said on Monday 900 cases were suspected, dismissing claims by a lawmaker from the holy Shi’ite city of Qom who said 50 people had died in the city, the epicenter of the new coronavirus outbreak. “It is an uninvited and inauspicious visitor. God willing we will get through ... this virus,” said Iranian President Hassan Rouhani in a televised speech. Iran, which confirmed its first two deaths last week in Qom, has yet to say how many people it has quarantined, but the semi-official Mehr news agency said 320 people had been hospitalized. The outbreak in Iran comes as its clerical rulers face mounting United States (US) pressure that has hit the economy hard. In 2018, the US exited Tehran’s nuclear deal with major powers and reimposed sanctions on the country.
