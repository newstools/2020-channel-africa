Two other soldiers were injured in the incident at a military base in Borno state and were taken to a military hospital in Maiduguri for treatment, army spokesperson Sagir Musa added. Borno state is one of the areas worst affected by the decade-long insurgency waged by Islamist insurgents in north-eastern Nigeria. In 2019, a retired officer, who now specialises in mental health, said many soldiers fighting Boko Haram militants were "suffering mental illness in silence".
