Demonstrators in the capital blocked traffic chanting slogans and burning effigies. Protester Hilal Abudrahman told AFP news agency it was the first demonstration he had taken part in. He added that he would be "ashamed" of himself if he did not show his "sentiments" against  Macron, who "supported this insult against our Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him". Another protester, Ahmed Sheik Mire, said  Macron had provoked Muslims and called for the devout "to show their anger with France". Muslims across the world have reacted furiously to Macron's remarks that came after the beheading of schoolteacher Samuel Paty, who had shown his pupils cartoons of Prophet Muhammad, depictions that are seen as offensive by many Muslims. --BBC--
