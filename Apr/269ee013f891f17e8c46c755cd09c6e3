South Africa, which is under a three-week lockdown, has recently introduced regulations which make sharing or reporting misinformation about Covid-19 illegal and punishable by up to six months in prison, a fine, or both. Steven Birch allegedly posted a video claiming that South Africa’s coronavirus testing kits were contaminated and could infect people. In a video, which has been widely circulated, he said about the 10 000 workers going door-to-door, to test for coronavirus: “Do not under any circumstances allow them to test you. “There’s a possibility the swabs are contaminated with Covid-19.” In the video, he also says that, globally, the swabs are used to "spread the virus". South Africa began widespread testing this week and the health department wants to be able to test 30 000 people daily by the end of the month. Officials have expressed concerns that the video could hamper their efforts by spreading mistrust and fear. The police say Birch was charged under the Disaster Management Act in relation to “publishing any statement through any medium including social media with the intention to deceive any other person about measures by the government to address Covid-19”. Birch appeared briefly in the Cape Town Magistrates' Court and was released with a warning to be back in court in July. He has yet to plead. --BBC--
