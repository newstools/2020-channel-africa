Each MP was due to receive about $5 300 to, among other things, fuel ambulances and pay allowances for the drivers involved in the COVID-19 taskforces at district level, the newspaper reports quoting sources in parliament. The proposal sparked a public outcry and an online petition. The petition said the money should go to the COVID-19 Task Force instead of MPs. It said that many of the MPs were not in their constituencies because of lock down. Two opposition MPs on Tuesday succeeded in getting a court order suspending the allocation. --BBC--
