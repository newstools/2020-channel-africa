Africa has seen about 1.4 million cases, and 34 000 deaths since March 2020. These figures are far lower than those in Europe, Asia or the Americas, with reported cases continuing to decline. Early interventions played a crucial role in curbing the virus' spread, Dr John Nkengasong, told the BBC's Newsday programme. He described as "false" suggestions that cases and deaths in Africa were significantly under-reported. "We may not have been picking all the cases, just like in other parts of the world but we are not seeing people around the continent falling dead on the streets or mass burials going on," Nkengasong said. All African states introduced a series of measures to tackle the virus as soon as the first cases were reported in March 2020. Many, including South Africa and Nigeria, introduced nationwide lockdowns, but others such as Ethiopia opted for less strict measures. Nkengasong, however, attributed the low number to a "joint continental effort", which focused on "scaling up testing and following up contact tracing and very importantly masking", or the wearing of face masks. "In many countries, including Ethiopia where I live, if you go to the streets of Addis Ababa you will see there is almost 100% masking," he added. --BBC--
