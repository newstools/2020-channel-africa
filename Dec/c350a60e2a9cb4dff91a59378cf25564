The insects have been ravaging East Africa all year, and now they are in southern Africa in what is the biggest outbreak in over a decade. It’s a different species of locust to those in East Africa but they can be just as destructive. And if they aren't stopped now, food security in South Africa’s main agricultural areas will come under threat. The BBC tracked a swarm and went locust-busting with a small team of dedicated insecticide sprayers in the Eastern Cape province. The team has so far sprayed about 1 000 swarms this year. --BBC--
