President, Cyril Ramaphosa, announced last week five levels of lockdown regulations in hopes of helping to curb the deadly coronavirus pandemic sweeping the world. South Africa’s infections have jumped rapidly this past week with 297 new Covid-19 cases confirmed on Thursday. With Level 4 lockdown restrictions starting, the South African Football Association (SAFA) has released a statement and has acquired further information from two medical experts. "SAFA has taken note of the above and has further invited the opinion of two medical experts to submit reports on when it would be safe to resume playing football in our country,” the statement read. “SAFA will submit a full report to the world football governing body, FIFA on the impact of Covid-19 on football in our country and when SAFA believes it will be safe to resume football again. SAFA will work with the government led by the Minister of Sports, Arts and Culture, Nathi Mthethwa, in this process. "As things stand, the two experts argue that football can only be played on Level 1 but still without spectators and that all clubs must have full-time Sports Doctors to manage the Covid-19 situation." Playing football requires travelling, including from one province to the other and that cannot be achieved under Level 4. Another issue is the social distancing factor - football is a contact sport where ‘we cannot social distance’. --News24--
