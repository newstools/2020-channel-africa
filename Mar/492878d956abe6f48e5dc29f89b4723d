The announcement was made by the Empowerment Removal Committee, which was formed last year to break apart structures still lingering from Bashirâ€™s 29-year rule.

The sackings were meant to "eliminate the empowerment of the former regime in the foreign ministry that suffered a lot from the interference of the former regime," government spokesperson, Mohamed al-Faki, is quoted as saying by France-based news site Sudan Tribune. The 109 people fired from Ministry of Foreign Affairs included ambassadors, diplomats and administrators, Faki told a press conference in the capital, Khartoum. Some of the dismissed diplomats were appointed by Bashir through presidential decrees, an ERC member told journalists.
