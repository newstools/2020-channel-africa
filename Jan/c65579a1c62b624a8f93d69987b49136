The Ukraine International Airlines Boeing 737 was brought down by a missile shortly after taking off on Wednesday from Tehran, killing all 176 passengers and crew on board. The Kiev-bound plane was knocked out of the sky hours after Tehran had launched a wave of missiles at United States (US) troops in Iraq in retaliation for the killing of a top Iranian general. "In these sorrowful days, many criticisms were directed at relevant officials and authorities, some officials were even accused of lying and a cover-up but, in all honesty, that was not the case.‚Äù said Government Spokesperson, Ali Rabiei. The spokesperson said all details provided by officials before Saturday's revelation had been based on the information they had. "All of those who expressed opinions on those days, at the peak of America's psychological war... did so based on existing information at the time." The Islamic republic for three days denied Western claims based on US intelligence that the airliner had been downed by a missile before acknowledging that version was correct on Saturday. --News24--
