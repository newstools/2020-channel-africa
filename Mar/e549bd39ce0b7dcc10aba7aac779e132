This followed a contraction of 0.8% in the third quarter, which means that the economy was in recession for the last half of 2019. South Africa last entered a recession, when the GDP falls for two consecutive quarters, in the second quarter of 2018.  This is South Africa's third recession since 1994. For the whole of 2019, the South African economy grew by only 0.2% (in real terms). In 2018, it saw growth of only 0.8%. The fourth-quarter decline is larger than what economists had predicted, as the economy battles the fallout of load shedding. Seven out of 10 industries contracted in the fourth quarter, with agriculture (-7.6%) taking the biggest hit. The manufacturing industry shrank 1.8% in the fourth quarter, while the transport, storage and communication industry saw a decline of 7.2% Stats SA reports that household spending increased by 1.4% in the final quarter of 2019, but spending on clothing and footwear was up by 8,5%. The weak growth is likely to add more woes to President Cyril Ramaphosa's government, as the economy under his leadership continues to suffer, amid internal and external pressures. --News24-- BREAKING NEWS | South Africa enters recession #sabcnews pic.twitter.com/FsDUoKKQm6 BREAKING NEWS | South Africa enters recession #sabcnews pic.twitter.com/FsDUoKKQm6 [BREAKING NEWS]South Africa has entered to a Recession as the Economy on Q4 of 2019 Decreases by 1.4%The Economy grew by 0.8% in 2018 following previous 1.3% GDP Growth in 2017 under ZumaThis is SA’s 2nd Recession since 2018 under Cyril Ramaphosa as President BREAKING NEWS!#StatsSA has announced that South Africa has slipped into its third recession since 1994 in the fourth quarter of 2019, shrinking by 1.4%, #GDP pic.twitter.com/miPnUPgLqK South Africa now in recession #RecessionSA #SArecession pic.twitter.com/szORRSPq0j Thanks to the recession I'm back on my feet again.The bank took my car. #RecessionSA
