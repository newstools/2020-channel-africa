The country’s largest pension fund administrator, which held an investment and economic outlook roundtable on Thursday morning, has always adopted an optimistic view of SA’s prospects. CEO Dawie de Villiers often argues that with few positive tweaks, the local economy can take off. But Mhlanga adopted a more cautious stance this week, saying that Moody’s, the only one of the big three rating agencies that still has SA on an investment grade will likely downgrade the country in 2020. 

SA has escaped a downgrade a few times when local economists predicted a downgrade in the past. But this time, given that the agency put SA on a negative outlook in November, there is little room to wriggle out of becoming another junk country, especially because not much has become of the promises the finance minister made in the medium-term budget last year. Moody’s is scheduled to review SA’s credit rating in March. "We expect a credit rating downgrade from Moody’s this year because the pace of structural reforms which are required to lift growth has been too slow. Nothing much can be done between now and February to give a strong indication that reforms are going to come through," said Mhlanga.
