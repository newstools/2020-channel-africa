The two countries are currently pursuing talks for a comprehensive free trade agreement, scheduled to start at the same time as the Continental African Free Trade Area comes into force. Kenya, which already exports many duty-free products to the US market, will become Washington’s 11th African trading partner and sixth in sub-Saharan Africa. Both countries announced formation of a working group to “lay the groundwork for a stronger future trade relationship” in August 2018, the same year the relationship between the two countries was upped to a strategic partnership. Trump and Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta officially agreed to pursue trade negotiations in February 2020. The US and Kenya also announced a new strategic cooperation framework meant to help Kenya benefit fully from the African Growth and Opportunity Act, which allows most products from sub-Saharan Africa into the US duty free. The program is scheduled to expire in 2025. --AfricaNews--
