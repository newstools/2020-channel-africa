Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he had no symptoms. "I have been identified as a contact of someone who has tested positive for Covid-19. I am well and without symptoms but will self-quarantine over the coming days, in line with WHO protocols, and work from home," he said in a tweet. "My WHO colleagues and I will continue to engage with partners in solidarity to save lives and protect the vulnerable," he added. The 55-year-old former Ethiopian health minister said "it is critically important that we all comply with health guidance". "This is how we will break chains of Covid-19 transmission, suppress the virus, and protect health systems." Dr Tedros, as he likes to be known, is the first African head of the WHO. He has weathered bitter criticism - most notably from the US - of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, which the WHO declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on January 30.
