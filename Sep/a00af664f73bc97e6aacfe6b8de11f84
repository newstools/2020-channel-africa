United’s cuts include 6920 flight attendants, but the union representing them said 14 000 will not have a paycheck in October unless Congress acts to extend $25 billion in aid. This is because many have opted for leaves that will provide healthcare but no money, Association of Flight Attendants-CWA International President Sara Nelson said. “United’s furlough announcement does not tell the full story,” she said. Airlines have been lobbying Washington for a second stimulus package to protect jobs through March 2020 while the industry awaits a recovery. 

The first $25 billion, which covered airline payrolls, expires this month, but talks have stalled as Congress has struggled to reach agreement on a broader coronavirus assistance package. Chicago-based United had over 90 000 employees before the pandemic brought the industry to a near standstill in March. It warned in July that 36 000 jobs were at risk of involuntary furloughs as demand remained weak. US passenger airlines are still collectively losing more than $5 billion a month as 30% of planes remain parked. Passenger travel demand is down about 70% and, on average, planes that are flying are half-full.
