Ebo forest in south-western Cameroon is home to 40 Banen communities and numerous endangered wildlife species - including western gorillas, chimpanzees, forest elephants, grey parrots and large frogs. Experts say forests also play a critical role in the absorption of CO2 from the atmosphere. On Tuesday Cameroon's government formally announced it was cancelling a previous decree that would have allowed timber extraction across nearly half of the 150,000-hectare forest. Greenpeace responded on Thursday, saying the suspension of logging operations must be the first step towards protecting the lives of Ebo's residents. It has vowed to keep campaigning, along with its partner Rainforest Rescue. But a government official told the BBC that the forest will eventually be reclassified either as a logging concession or as a protected forest. "The present statement will not last long," said Cameroon's Ministry of Forestry and Wildlife Communications Director Jean Robert Onana. "Classification is a normal procedure and a legal procedure. If we donâ€™t classify this forest, it is subject to poaching or illegal logging." He added that Cameroon is conscious of the need for environmental conservation, pointing to the fact that 30% of the national territory is under conservation. --BBC--
