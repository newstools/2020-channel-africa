There had been rumours that the tour dates would be pushed back to a later stage amid plans for a global season, but the publication insists that the tour will still place from July 3 to August 7 next year. "We had to make a call on this now as we were running out of time," a source told The Telegraph. "People need to move on tickets, flights and hotel bookings and it is so important to South Africa to have certainty now given the financial importance of the tour to them at a time when we are all struggling with the impact of Covid-19." The Lions last toured South Africa in 2009 when the Springboks ran out 2-1 series victors.
