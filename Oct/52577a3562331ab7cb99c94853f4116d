The US speech, seen by Reuters, came at a meeting of the World Trade Organization’s Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) which gave its formal clearance on Monday for the EU to impose tariffs on $4 billion of US goods. “The United States strongly favours a negotiated resolution of its dispute with the EU over the massive launch aid subsidies it provided to Airbus. The United States has recently provided proposals for a reasonable settlement that would provide a level playing field,” the US delegation said. The original WTO ruling on October 13 had deepened a record trade dispute that has already prompted Washington to impose duties on EU imports over state aid for Airbus. Few analysts expect the EU to act before US presidential elections next week.
