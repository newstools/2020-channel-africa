 Armed bandits riding dozens of motorbikes attacked areas of Safana, Dutsinma and Danmusa - shooting people dead and burning down homes in several villages. The attacks follow months of relative peace in the region. Buhari suggested that criminals are taking advantage of the lockdown measures imposed to contain the spread of COVID-19 to carry out attacks. He urged Nigerians not to despair in the face of the killings. In recent years, states in the north-western part of the country have been badly affected by armed gangs who attack residents and travellers. They kill and kidnap people for ransom. --BBC--
