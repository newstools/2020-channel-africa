Maesaiah Thabane's bail was revoked last week. Thabane has also been named as a suspect in the killing of Lipolelo, who was shot dead three years ago, days before Thabane was sworn in as prime minister. The couple has denied involvement in the murder. The case has caused significant political upheaval in Lesotho. Thabane stepped down as prime minister last month, following sustained pressure from his own party. --BBC--
