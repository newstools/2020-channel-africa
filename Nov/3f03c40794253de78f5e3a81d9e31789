Carlo Ancelotti dropped goalkeeper Jordan Pickford, whose mistakes have cost Everton a number of goals so far this season, and handed a debut to Swedish international Robin Olsen, who joined from AS Roma on loan at the beginning of October. Newcastle went ahead when Wilson scored from the spot following an innocuous foul by Andre Gomes on the striker in the 54th minute, and he added a second by bundling home a cross from Ryan Fraser five minutes from the end of normal time. Calvert-Lewin scored a stoppage-time consolation goal for Everton but Newcastle survived to take a win that puts them in 10th position on 11 points, while Everton are second on 13, three points behind Merseyside rivals Liverpool. --IOL--
