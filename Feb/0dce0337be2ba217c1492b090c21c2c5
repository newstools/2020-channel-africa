The Canadian has not played a competitive match since she won the final major of the year at Flushing Meadows in September 2019. She had high hopes of returning at the start of the year for the Australian Open, but pulled out and then penciled in the Fed Cup over the weekend as a possible return date. However, she didn't feature for Canada in the team competition and has now also pulled out of next week's WTA Premier event in the Middle East. "I'm very sad to announce that I won't be able to compete in the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships next week," she said. "I'm not at 100% yet and following my team and doctor's recommendation, I don't want to take any risk to re-injure my knee. "Each day I get closer to being back to the court competing but Dubai is just too soon. I hope I can come and play in Dubai 2021."Â
