There was a real fear this year, due to Covid-19 and the fact that South Africa have pulled out of Super Rugby to compete in an expanded Pro16, that the Boks would ditch the Southern Hemisphere's premium international tournament, and push for entry into the Six Nations. But as revealed by Sanzaar this morning, that will not happen. Instead, the Boks will play against Argentina, Australia and New Zealand until 2030 in a restructured Championship that will include 12 matches with teams playing each other home and away through a new mini-tournament match schedule. Said Andy Marinos, Sanzaar CEO: “The recommitment by the four Unions to the long term future of the international game is an important start as we embark in a new direction for both the Unions and the organisation over the coming years." “This is the first of a number of announcements that will be made over the coming weeks and months as we continue to plan into 2021 and beyond," Marinos continued. "The disruption during 2020 has been significant, however, despite the numerous setbacks and the inherent complexity of our vast geographical expanse, we have managed to keep the game alive and look forward to the remainder of the revised Tri Nations to bring the curtain down on the 2020 season." Concerns over player welfare as the Boks had less time to prepare than Australia and New Zealand. former Bok captain, Corne Krige shares his thoughts on this.
