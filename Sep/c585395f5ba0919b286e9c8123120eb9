The remarks are from a new book by Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, which comes out on Tuesday. In the book, Cohen claims Trump made racist comments about Nelson Mandela. He claimed Trump said the late South African President was "no leader". "Tell me one country run by a black person that isn't a shithole. They are all complete shit toilets," Trump once said, according to Cohen. The White House says the lawyer is lying. The Nelson Mandela Foundation has said it did not believe that "leaders who conduct themselves in the way Trump does are in a position to offer authoritative commentary on the life and work of Madiba". "Reflecting on leadership, Madiba once said: “A good leader can engage in a debate frankly and thoroughly, knowing that at the end he and the other side must be closer and thus emerge stronger. You don't have that idea when you are arrogant, superficial, and uninformed.” We would recommend these words to Trump for consideration”, the foundation said in a statement. --BBC--
