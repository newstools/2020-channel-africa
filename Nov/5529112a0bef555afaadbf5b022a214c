He said the government wants to "hear concrete and practical ideas" from young people. It follows weeks of demonstrations by thousands of young Nigerians across the country to protest against police brutality and bad governance in the country. "Every successful protest movement the world over has understood that there comes a time when activity must move from the street to the negotiation table. That time for you has come. Do not be afraid of this reality. You should welcome it," Buhari said in a speech to mark the African Youth Day. He was represented at the event by the Federal Capital Territory Minister, Muhammad Bello. --BBC--
