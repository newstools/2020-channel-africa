Harry was shown arriving on Vancouver Island by Sky News, just days after reaching an arrangement with Queen Elizabeth and senior royals that will see him and his wife Meghan leave behind their royal roles to seek an independent future. Buckingham Palace and the queen said on Saturday that Harry and Meghan would no longer be working members of the royal family. 

They would not use their “Royal Highness” titles and would pay their own way in life, freeing them to forge a new future in Canada and the United States. Harry has admitted he had not wanted to step away entirely from his royal life and his military appointments, but said there was no other option. “It brings me great sadness that it has come to this,” he said on Sunday. American actress Meghan returned to Canada on Janaury 10 to be reunited with baby son Archie, and Harry flew out late on Monday to join her.
