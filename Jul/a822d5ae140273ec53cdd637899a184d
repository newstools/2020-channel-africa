The Alarm Phone organisation, which runs a hotline for people in trouble in the Mediterranean, said one of the vessels rang for help, complaining of engine problems. The boats are reported to be taking on water, with those on board panicking. The migrants say they are unable to remove the water because of overcrowding. Alarm Phone said neither the Maltese nor the Italian authorities were responding to their requests for help. --BBC--
