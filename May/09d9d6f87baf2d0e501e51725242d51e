This is a subsidised rate for a test that costs around $100 at private hospitals in the country. The Government this week allowed restaurants to reopen but patrons must wash their hands at the entrance, wear a face mask and be seated 1.5 metres apart. Previously restaurants were only allowed to serve takeouts. Health Minister, Mutahi Kagwe, said owners of the eateries would only reopen their businesses once their employees test negative for coronavirus. Director General of Health, Patrick Amoth, told KTN news channel on Thursday that hotel workers will be tested after every 14 days."Because this is a new disease and is a daily moving target, as more information becomes available, that shall be able to guide us going forward as to the frequency of the testing," Amoth said. --BBC--
