The five biggest United States (US) and European firms, known as the Oil Majors, have announced spending cuts averaging 23% in a rapid response to the precipitous fall in oil demand because of the coronavirus pandemic and a 65% slump in crude prices. With the rout likely to extend for months, the pressure on balance sheets remains extreme as very few parts of oil company businesses make money at the current oil price of $20 a barrel. “This remains a brutal business environment,” BP Chief Executive Officer Bernard Looney said on Thursday. From Exxon Mobil  to Royal Dutch Shell, companies have put projects on hold, slashed production in US shale fields and reduced operations at refineries to deal with the double whammy of a drop in demand and a supply glut. But more steps are likely to be needed and investors will be watching closely for changes to output forecasts and to see how companies plan to manage dividends, the most important incentive for shareholders worth more than $40 billion combined in 2019. --Reuters--
