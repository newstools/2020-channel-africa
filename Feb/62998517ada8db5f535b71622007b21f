Fred Matiang'i signed the deportation order just hours after the court had allowed police to detain the four individuals for 15 more days. No court charges have yet been made. The four were arrested on February 9 after detectives raided Chez Wou Restaurant in the capital, Nairobi's Kileleshwa suburb. After questioning it was discovered that only one of them had a work permit. They were presented in court on Thursday where the prosecution's request for more time to investigate was granted.
