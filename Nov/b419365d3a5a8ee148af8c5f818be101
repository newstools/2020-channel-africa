The couple turned themselves in Malawi's capital, Lilongwe, on Wednesday morning, the BBC's reporter Nomsa Maseko says. Earlier in November they were released on bail by a South African court after being charged with fraud and money laundering. He had previously said that he wanted to clear his name. Bushiri told his supporters on social media on Saturday that his decision to skip bail was because he had been receiving death threats. He also accused the South African authorities of not offering protection. South Africa had initiated the process of extraditing the couple and on Monday issued a warrant for their arrest.
