The warning comes as infections continue to spike in many countries that have recently been easing restrictions. The health body said the virus will run out of control if African countries continued opening up without adequate interventions in place. It also warned of a return to lockdowns - which the continent cannot afford. WHO Regional Director for Africa, Matshidiso Moeti, also said measures are in place to ensure the continent gets its fair share of any vaccine developed. Africa has reported more that 1.6 million coronavirus cases since the pandemic began with more than 39,000 deaths. --BBC--
