The tweets had condemned United States (US) President Donald Trump for ordering the killing of Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani, the AFP news agency reports. The tweets mentioned that Trump "threatens world peace and has made the US a rogue state". The statements was posted on Monday and has since been deleted, but were widely shared. The Malian government explained that the President's account had been "temporarily pirated by ill-intentioned individuals", AFP said. Keita's former spokesperson, Tiegoum Maiga, said he had authored the tweets. "It was neither pirates, nor hackers, (but) a regrettable handling error," he said in French on his own Twitter account. Maiga said the tweets were meant for his personal account and that he had forgotten he still had access to the president's account. He left his job as the President's aide in November.
