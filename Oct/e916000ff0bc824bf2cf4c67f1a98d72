Some companies are using letters of credit to import critical raw materials, chaiperson of the Zimbabwe Fertiliser Manufacturers Association, Tapiwa Mashingaidze said. Zimbabwe requires at least 400 000 tonnes of fertilisers in a normal season. Over the past years, fertiliser producers struggled to secure foreign currency to import raw materials and this resulted in low production and serious shortages. Demand for this season is likely to be strong on the back of good rains. Government-assisted farming programmes such as Presidential inputs schemes are also expected to increase demand. “We have managed to get foreign currency from the auction market and this has helped producers to import some raw materials. So we are likely to have stable supplies this farming season,” said Mashingaidze. “From our side, the capacity to supply is there. What can only affect demand is low disposable incomes on the part of our customers.” Zimbabwe is expecting an early rainy season, starting with scattered falls this month, firming into heavy rains next month.  --Herald--
