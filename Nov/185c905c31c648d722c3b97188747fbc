The 25-year-old forward, who was born in London to a Ugandan mother, has been called up by Uganda for their double-header Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers against South Sudan. The Cranes prospect met up with CALM Africa representatives Anthony Bateman and Terry Goddard at Wycombe’s Adams Park Stadium earlier this week to present them with the donation. CALM Africa is a charitable organisation, focusing on the promotion, observance and protection of children’s rights in Uganda, and is concerned with the plight of vulnerable children in particular. “It will be an honour to represent my country and I’m humbled to be involved in this fantastic project which will result in many young children in Uganda receiving these gifts from Wycombe Wanderers,” Uche told his club’s official website. “I’m extremely proud of my roots in Uganda – a country I have had the pleasure of visiting a number of times and thank CALM Africa for making it possible for us to help many young children in this way.” CALM Africa’s patron Anthony Bateman added: “Uche has the potential to be a real role model for young people in Uganda, who love their football and for whom sport and education can be an important vehicle for their development. “This is a wonderful gesture from Wycombe Wanderers and we know that the children will love receiving these items and following the club’s progress for many years to come. Thank you to the club and to Uche for thinking of us in this way.”  --AllAfrica--
