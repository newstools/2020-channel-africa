The experts sitting in the committee will advise African countries on the science, safety and quality of traditional medicine. It will support countries to ensure clinical trials of traditional medicines comply with international standards, according to a statement by the WHO. "As the world races to find treatment and vaccines against the virus, research into traditional and orthodox medicines as potential Covid-19 therapy must be grounded in science," Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO Regional Director for Africa, was quoted in the statement as saying. The formation of the committee comes as Madagascar, which has been promoting a herbal "remedy" for Covid-19, is reported to be overwhelmed by the number of infected people. Nigeria said it had conducted tests and could not find evidence that Madagascar's herbal tonic actually works. --BBC--
