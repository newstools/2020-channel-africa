That amounts to almost half of the company's total United States (US)-based frontline workforce.

“Throughout this crisis, we have been honest and direct with you about our need to right-size our workforce to match travel demand,” it said.

The carrier said it expects capacity for this month to be down 75% compared to July 2020.

The company also said that not everyone who receives a warning letter will definitely be furloughed, with the final number depending on whether trading conditions improve and how many workers accept offers of redundancy and temporary leave.

“Our primary goal throughout this crisis has been to ensure United - and the jobs it supports - are here when customers are flying again,” United Airlines said in a statement to employees.

In response to the announcement the Association of Flight Attendants union said: "The United Airlines projected furlough numbers are a gut punch, but they are also the most honest assessment we've seen on the state of the industry."

The US government has offered $50 billion to support the airline industry which has agreed to not lay off staff or cut pay until September 30.

United Airlines is receiving $5 billion of those funds and won't make any cutbacks until October 1, it said.
