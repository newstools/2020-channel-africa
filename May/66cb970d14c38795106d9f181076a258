Kvitova is playing at an all-Czech tournament in Prague, where eight men and eight women are competing behind closed doors and under stringent measures to prevent the virus from spreading.

"Of all tournaments that have been cancelled, the news about Wimbledon was the most upsetting for me," the 30-year-old, who won the grass-court major in 2011 and 2014, told AFP.            

"I'm not saying I cried when I heard it, but I was pretty gutted on that day. I guess the reason is clear," added the current world number 12. Hygiene is key at the event where no one will hand the towel to the players who must also wear face masks at press conferences.   

The ball boys and ball girls are wearing gloves, though the players share a set of balls. Instead of shaking hands at the end of each game, they do a "racquet bump" to avoid infection. Organisers cancelled the Grand Slam scheduled for early July on April 1, for the first time since World War II.   

"I will miss the atmosphere of the tournament of course, besides the experiences and memories of last year," said fellow Czech Barbora Strycova, who made the singles semi-finals and took the doubles honours with Taiwan's Hsieh Su-Wei in 2019. "I always like to get back to Wimbledon because when I'm there it feels special. For me it's the most important and greatest tournament of all," said the 34-year-old. --News24--
