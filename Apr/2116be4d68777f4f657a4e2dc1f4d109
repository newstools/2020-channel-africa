A statement from the PGA of America said the tournament scheduled to take place at Harbor Shores Resort in Benton Harbor, Michigan, had been axed after state authorities issued a stay-at-home order on March 23. "While we are incredibly disappointed, we all understand that protecting public health is the highest priority," said PGA of America Chief Executive Seth Waugh. The 2021 Senior PGA Championship will be played at Southern Hills Country Club in Tulsa, Oklahoma, but the tournament will return to Harbor Shores in 2022. Golf has faced severe disruption since the Covid-19 pandemic erupted, with play halted on the USPGA, US LPGA and European tours. The Masters and PGA Championship have been postponed, and the two remaining men's majors, the US Open and British Open, are under threat.
