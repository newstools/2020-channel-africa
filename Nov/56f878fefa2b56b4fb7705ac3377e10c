This has been disclosed by Minister of Agriculture, Jabulani Mabuza, who said the kingdom was highly grateful to Japan for the kind gesture. Mabuza assured farmers that government was working tirelessly to support farmers recover from the effects of COVID-19. He called upon all development partners, the donor community, financiers and stakeholders to consider farmers in COVID-19 recovery interventions. “The country is undergoing an economic recession, a situation that has been worsened by the COVID-19 global pandemic. Effects of the pandemic were visible across all sectors, and the agriculture sector has not been spared,” said Mabuza. Mabuza explained that the pandemic, among other things, affected supply chains, restricted movements, and re-organised or reduced demand of some agricultural food commodities. “This resulted in many farmers and farming enterprises experiencing profit losses, some were forced to shut down operations, and lay-offs were inevitable,” added Mabuza. European Union (EU) Ambassador, Esmeralda Hernandez Aragones, hailed farmers for their resilience even during tough times. She reiterated the EU’s commitment towards ensuring food security. She disclosed that the EU was currently engaging various stakeholders in programming for post 2020 development agenda. “Again, the country prioritises, inclusive of agriculture, look likely to be part of our programmes. This, if it materialises, will give another great opportunity for local farmers to be supported in their contribution towards economic growth in the country,” said Aragones. --Observer--
