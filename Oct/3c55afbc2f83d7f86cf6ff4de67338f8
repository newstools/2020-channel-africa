The 22-year-old, who won gold at the World Championships in Doha in 2019, was charged and provisionally suspended by the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) in June. According to World Athletics Anti-Doping Rules any combination of three whereabouts failures, filing failures or missed tests, within a 12-month period by an athlete constitutes an anti-doping violation. Athletes guilty of whereabouts failures could face two-year bans or a minimum of one year depending on the degree of fault. In Naser’s case, the disciplinary tribunal upheld three of the four AIU charges against her, a filing failure effective January 1, 2019 and two missed tests, on March 12, 2019 and January 24 this year. However, the tribunal found in Naser’s favour with regard to a third alleged missed test on April 12, 2019, which resulted in the charges being dismissed because her three whereabouts failures did not occur within a 12-month rolling period. "This was a case very much on the borderline and we hope the athlete will learn from the experience and heed the AIU's warnings," the tribunal said in a statement. --Reuters--
