CIB is listed on both the Egyptian and London stock exchanges, and boasts an asset base in excess of $24 billion. The Egyptian lender acquired a majority stake of 51 % in Kenya’s Mayfair Bank by way of a $35 million capital injection. On April 24, Kenya’s Central Bank announced the conclusion of the CIB-Mayfair deal, having approved the transaction on April 7. MBL, which was licensed in June 2017, is classified by the regulator as a small bank with a market share of 0.17 %. It mainly serves high net worth individuals and corporate customers. The Egyptian lender focuses on individuals, small and medium enterprises (SMEs), institutions and corporates. “The Mayfair Bank-CIB partnership is expected to benefit customers and broaden trade between Kenya and Egypt,” says Mayfair chairperson Anjay Patel in a statement. He adds that the injected funds will be added to the bank’s capital base, and that all existing shareholders will continue in the institution. CIB says it is attracted by East Africa’s openness to trade, increased adoption of digital banking, increased level of financial inclusion and the relatively stable political environment. --TheEastAfrican--
