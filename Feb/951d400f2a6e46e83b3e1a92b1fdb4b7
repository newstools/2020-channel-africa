Maesaiah Thabane, 42, spend the night in custody after she came out of hiding and turned herself in to the police earlier on Tuesday. "She has been charged with murder alongside eight others who are in Lesotho and South Africa," Deputy Police Commissioner, Paseka Mokete, told reporters, adding that investigations had been "satisfactorily completed". He said police had a "strong case" against the First Lady, who was unable to appear in court on Tuesday due to logistical reasons. She went missing last month after being summoned as part of an investigation into the killing of Lipolelo Thabane, Prime Minister Thomas Thabane's estranged wife. The couple was involved in bitter divorce proceedings when she was gunned down outside her home in Lesotho's capital Maseru in June 2017, two days before her husband's inauguration. New evidence surfaced in early January, when a letter from Lesotho's police chief was made public alleging that communication records from the day of the crime picked up the Prime Minister's mobile number. Thabane, who is now 80, has since bowed to pressure and offered to resign at a date not yet disclosed. He has also been questioned by the police over the killing. But his current wife vanished when the police called her in to testify last month, prompting the issuing of an arrest warrant. Maesaiah was picked up on the border with South Africa following an arrangement between her lawyer and the police. --News24--
