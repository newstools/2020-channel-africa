According to provisional results announced on October 24 by the electoral commission, the head of state, 82 years old, was reappointed for a third controversial term by obtaining 59.5% of the votes cast. Guinean opposition leader Cellou Dalein Diallo said Wednesday that a blockade of his home, imposed by the security forces following tumultuous presidential elections on October 18, had been lifted. "We discovered on the stroke of noon that we could go in and out. They packed up without warning, in the same way that they had come," Diallo told the press. Police barricaded the politician in his home in the capital Conakry after he declared victory a day after the vote -- a claim denied by the government and which led to lethal clashes. On Tuesday, mediators from the United Nations, African Union and regional bloc ECOWAS called on the "security measures" around Diallo's home to be lifted "in the spirit of inclusive dialogue." Diallo said that barricades around the headquarters of his party, the  Union of Democratic Forces of Guinea  (UFDG), and around his offices, remained in place. The security presence in reputedly pro-opposition districts of Conakry was also notably lighter on Wednesday. "We were surprised this morning to see that the troops deployed in our area had packed up and gone," said Souleymane Bangoura, an inhabitant of the district of Sonfonia. President Alpha Conde, 82, won the hotly-contested election according to official results announced Saturday, setting the stage for a controversial third term. Conde was a former opposition leader during years of hard line rule who in 2010 became the first democratically-elected President of one of Africa's poorest and most volatile states. But he has been accused by critics of authoritarian drift during his second term in office, which he won in 2015. --Africanews--
