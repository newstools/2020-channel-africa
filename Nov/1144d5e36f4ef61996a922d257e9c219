Several newspapers are reporting that 39-year-old Cameroonian football star Samuel Eto'o could make an unexpected comeback to play for a third-division club in Spain. Unconfirmed reports suggest the retired Chelsea and Barcelona striker could sign to lesser-known Racing Murcia. "Right now I would say our chances of signing Samuel Eto'o are 50-50," the club's president reportedly told Spanish-language news site Marca. Just a week ago, Eto'o escaped unhurt from a car crash that happened between the cities of Douala and Bafoussam in Cameroon. --BBC--
