The company on Friday reported that its losses during the half-year to December had widened to $7.1 million (R114.74 million) or 4.95cents a share, compared to a loss of $3.6 million or 2.49c per share, a year earlier. The company said the 30% decline in API4 coal prices resulted in revenue falling to $11.4 million from $15.2 million previously. Gross profit declined to $300 million from $2.9 million. Acting Chief Executive, Brenda Berlin, said the company was considering issuing new equity to existing shareholders in a bid to raise the $20 million balance required for the construction of phase 1 of the Makhado thermal coal mine. Berlin would also explore debt funding coupled with contractor funding to raise funding for the $37 million required to develop phase 1 of the Makhado mine. “Discussions with potential funders for the balance are progressing. We anticipate that this process should be completed in the first half of 2020, with construction commencing in the third quarter of 2020,” said Berlin. The completion of phase 1 would result in MC Mining being the pre-eminent South African producer of hard coking coal, she said. Berlin took over from David Brown, who stepped down in January. The company received a major boost when it received a $17.4m term-loan from the Industrial Development Corporation towards building phase 1 of the Makhado mine. The group said Makhado had all of the regulatory permits required to commence mining operations. The project had a 46-year mining life, of which phase 1 would be mined for nine-years, and phase 2 would be mined for the remaining 37 years. The construction of the phase 1 pit, plant and infrastructure would take nine months, with the first coal sales in month 10. The company said phase 1 would produce 540 000 tons of hard coking coal a year and 570 000 tons of a thermal coal by-product that would be trucked to the Musina siding for sale to the domestic and export customers using previously tested road and rail logistics infrastructure. MC Mining shares rose 32.78% to close at R2.39 on the JSE on Friday. --BusinessReport--
