The National Labour Commission secured a court order to enforce an earlier court injunction meant to end the strike and compel the healthcare workers to continue negotiations with the government. The nurses and midwives are demanding better terms of service including rent and transport allowances. The government has promised to conclude the negotiations within a month. The strike left many patients stranded in medical facilities across the country with reports of deaths in some health facilities. --BBC--
