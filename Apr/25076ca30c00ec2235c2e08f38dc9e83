Foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian made the comments during a daily briefing on Monday in response to accusations from the US government that authorities in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou are taking measures targeting Africans in the city. Several African countries have separately also demanded that China address their concerns that Africans, in particular in the southern city of Guangzhou, are being mistreated and harassed. Having brought under control the original outbreak centred on the city of Wuhan, China is now concerned about imported cases and is stepping up scrutiny of foreigners coming into the country and tightening border controls. It has denied any discrimination. In recent days Africans in Guangzhou have reported being ejected from their apartments by their landlords, being tested for coronavirus several times without being given results and being shunned and discriminated against in public. Such complaints have been made in local media, and on social media. --Reuters--
