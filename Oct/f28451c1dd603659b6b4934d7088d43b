"SARS of today is not the same SARS I established in 1984," Fulani Kwajafa said. He said the unit had been "turned into banditry". Officers from the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) have been accused of committing extrajudicial killings and torture. President Muhammadu Buhari announced the disbandment of the agency this week after thousands of Nigerians took to the streets to protest against police brutality. A new agency called Swat has been formed to take over duties performed by SARS but this has also been rejected by the protesters. The demonstrators have been using the hashtag #EndSars to push for their cause, which has since been endorsed by global celebrities such as Twitter founder Jack Dorsey, United States, rapper Kanye West, gospel singer Kirk Franklin, footballers Mesut Ozil and Marcus Rashford and Nigerian superstars Davido and Wizkid. On Friday, Twitter launched a clenched fist emoji in a show of support for the protests. --BBC--
