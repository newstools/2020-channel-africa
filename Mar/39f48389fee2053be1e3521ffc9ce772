The West African nation's health ministry said the virus was detected in a 45-year-old Ivorian man who had recently been in Italy. Those he had been in contact with had been identified and were being followed up, the ministry said. The coronavirus outbreak has now been labelled a pandemic by the World Health Organisation (WHO). WHO Chief, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said the number of cases outside China had increased 13-fold over the past two weeks. He said he was "deeply concerned" by "alarming levels of inaction" over the virus. A pandemic is a disease that is spreading in multiple countries around the world at the same time.
