In what will be its second office on the African continent after its Johannesburg bureau in South Africa, the Lagos division will host teams specialised in engineering, sales, politics and communications. Facebook hopes to develop products made by Africans, for Africans and the rest of the world. In 2016, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg went on his first business in Africa, meeting Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari and local businessmen in Lagos, where he now plans to further implement his company. Facebook's expansion on the African continent will certainly be watched by Western African countries. According to a study commissioned by the Social Media Company, Facebook's investments in infrastructures and connectivity in Sub Saharan Africa could generate over $57 billion for African economies over the next 5 years. --AfricaNews--
