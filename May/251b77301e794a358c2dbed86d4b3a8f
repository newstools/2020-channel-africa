The Gazette notice granting millers a licence to import came out on April 20 and only allows importation before May 30. “No miller is able to import maize into the country within the permitted window, which expires on May 30,” said Nicholas Hutchinson, group Chief Executive Officer(CEO) of Unga Ltd, adding, “the timelines are just unrealistic.” According to Paloma Fernandes, CEO of Cereal Millers Association, a body that brings together Kenya’s maize millers, two vessels were meant to ship maize to Kenya from Topolobampo, Mexico, but one contract has been cancelled with losses amounting to close to $1 million, while the other one will be diverted to another destination, as it can’t get to the country before the deadline. She said that the average time it takes to order and deliver from Mexico, the only source of white maize meeting GM-free per EU standards currently is between 60 and 70 days. Fernandes said the association’s request for an extension of the deadline to September 30 was rejected. Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Peter Munya told the Senate Agriculture Committee that the need for maize imports was necessitated by the contamination of the entire national maize stock in the strategic grain reserves with aflatoxin. The government said it has permitted millers to import about two million bags of white maize for human consumption and an extra two million bags of yellow maize for animal feeds at 14 % and 10 % duty respectively. Mwangi Wainaina, CEO of Mama Maize Millers, said the price of maize flour will likely go up in three weeks’ time. “Kenyans should brace for a biting shortage and for the price of unga to go up in the next three weeks,” he warned. --TheEastAfrica--
