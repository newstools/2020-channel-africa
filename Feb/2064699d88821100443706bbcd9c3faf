This series will see Rabada's first appearance since his one match ban in the Tests against England which saw him miss out at the Wanderers. The 24-year-old was then rested for the drawn ODI series and the Proteas' 2-1 T20 loss to Eoin Morgan's men. On Friday, Rabada will return to action for the first of three T20s against Australia at the Wanderers. Langeveldt believes that the month break will do a lot of good for Rabada. "Renewed focus is good thing with a bit of a break. A 24-year-old, who's playing for his country, is always under pressure," Langeveldt told reporters in Johannesburg on Wednesday. "Hopefully he brings that pace as it's always difficult to deal with at the back-end of an innings. Hopefully he'll bring the energy as well." It's been two years since Australia's horrid tour of South Africa in 2018. Prior to ball-tampering Test at Newlands, Rabada was subsequently suspended for the final two Tests in that series but saw his ban overturned. Langeveldt admitted that Rabada needs to find a way to control his aggression but backed him to go hard at the Australians. "KG is competitive by nature, he is a wicket-taker... We'll definitely make him use a few bumpers but it's also about him controlling the aggression. I back him to find a balance, being aggressive with lines and lengths."
