Sergeant John Kipyegon Kemei, who served in the office of Deputy President, William Ruto, was found with a gunshot wound to his chin. The bullet went through his skull and hit the ceiling, reports the Daily Nation newspaper. Local media report that he was at work on the day a former Kenyan cabinet minister visited the office accompanied by directors from an American firm to discuss an arms tender. The former Minister, Rashid Echesa, has since been charged with forgery. The United States firm, Eco Advanced Technologies, alleges that Echesa approached them with a fake deal to supply arms to the Kenyan military, and also allege that Echesa swindled them out of $113 727 in consultation fees. Echesa denies any wrongdoing and is out on bail. The policeman who died was among those due to be questioned over the alleged fake deal. His workmates decided to visit his house after failing to contact him since Wednesday, according to local media. Deputy President, William Ruto, wrote a message of condolence on Twitter. Ruto has been accused of allowing Echesa to use his office for business meetings, but has denied any involvement in the scandal. --BBC--
