Tunisia and Nigeria are dealing with confirmed cases from patients who had travelled from Italy. Health Minister Mutahi Kagwe said that the decision was reached following consultations with the Italian embassy. "The National Emergency Response Committee on Coronavirus has concluded that flights from North of Italy, specifically Verona and Milan be suspended effective March 3, 2020. This is part of Italy that is currently experiencing coronavirus incidents which could affect the safety of Kenyans," Kagwe said. But the World Health Organisation says that issuing travel advisories to countries with confirmed coronavirus cases will not help reduce the probability of an outbreak. More than 2 502 people have been infected with the virus in Italy and 79 people there have died, most of them elderly people. It is one of the worst-affected countries in Europe followed closely by France and Germany. Last week, Kenya also suspended direct flights from China.
