The United Nations' Acting Special Envoy for Libya, Stephanie Williams, described the accord as "a crucial sign of hope for the Libyan people". Addressing the ceremony in Arabic, Williams said the hard work ahead will be implementing the terms of the agreement. The internationally-recognised Libyan government in the capital, Tripoli, and the renegade General Khalifa Haftar in Benghazi have signed several ceasefire deals since the toppling of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. --BBC--
