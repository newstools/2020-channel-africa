Moreover, a subdued dollar paved the way for the rand to remain on the front foot. 

At the close of local trade, the rand quoted 0.55% stronger at R16.85/$, after trading in range of R16.84/$ - R17.07/$. 

The rand traded steady overnight as markets await another dreary United States jobs report later today. 

Expected range today R16.70/$ - R17.10/$. --iol--
