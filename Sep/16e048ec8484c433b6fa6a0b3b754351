The non-governmental organisation said it had verified gruesome footage and photos from the region showing crimes against detainees. The materials show the attempted beheading, torture and other ill-treatment of prisoners, it said. They also show the dismemberment of alleged opposition fighters, possible extrajudicial executions and the transport and discarding of a large number of corpses into apparent mass graves, it added. Amnesty says the perpetrators of the atrocities in the videos are seen wearing the uniforms of the Mozambique Armed Defence Forces (FADM) and the Mozambique Rapid Intervention Police (PIR). The perpetrators refer to their captives as al-Shabab, it said - in reference to a common local name for the Islamist armed group operating in Cabo Delgado. In recent weeks there has been an increase in violence in northern Mozambique, where militants have been attacking security forces and civilians. --BBC--
