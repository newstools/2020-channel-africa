President Yoweri Museveni said that Ugandans should exercise at home and added that he would post a video on social media to demonstrate how this can be done. The directive comes after videos and photos of people jogging and doing aerobics in groups in the capital, Kampala, were shared on social media. The president also banned movement of motorcycle taxis, commonly known as boda bodas, beyond 14:00 local time (11:00 GMT). The motorbikes are currently only allowed to carry cargo and not passengers. The health ministry on Wednesday announced that they had confirmed one more case of coronavirus, bringing the total number to 53. More than 3,600 people have been tested so far according to the ministry. The country is on a nationwide two-week lockdown. --BBC--
