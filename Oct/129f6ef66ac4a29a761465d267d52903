The hotly anticipated fight will take place in California on November 28, and both fighters are reported to be taking the bout seriously. Having seen Tyson’s workout videos, Jones fears he could lose his life in the ring, but it’s a risk he’s prepared to take. Plus, he says he’ll “die a happy man” should that happen. “You get hit by someone like Mike Tyson, anything can happen to you,” Jones said in an interview with the UK’s The Sun. “Mike Tyson is not just an ordinary puncher. He’s one of those guys that can do just that to you,” said the 51-year-old. “So, you should know what you’re going into and you should be ready for that because this is Mike. For me, I don’t really give a damn, I fight for a living,” he said. “I ain’t trippin’ at all because I know death is a possibility. Yeah, that can happen to anybody. And I know it can happen to me even more going in there with somebody as dangerous as Mike Tyson. “Problem with me is, why I love and why I do what I do, because I love boxing. So if I gotta die boxing, I die a happy man,” Jones said. --IOL--
