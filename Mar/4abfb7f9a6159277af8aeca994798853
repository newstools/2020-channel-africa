A Sugar Industry Stakeholders Report recently released by a taskforce appointed by President Uhuru Kenyatta has also recommended the barring of local millers from importing sugar from Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (Comesa). The report blames the imports for the glut in the market, and causing a slump in local sugar prices. “Lack of a nationwide availability of local affordable sugar especially along the long porous borders encourages seepage of illegal sugar into the country,” the report says. “This sugar is not only cheaper but its quality cannot be vouched for, exposing consumers to health risks.” Kenya is currently a net importer of sugar mainly from Comesa countries. The Comesa imports are duty free, meaning the sugar is cheaper than the locally produced, giving incentives for more imports. Further, the country does not produce refined sugar, and relies on imports, creating an opportunity for diversion of the same to the consumer market. “In the past, millers have been allowed to import sugar during periods of shortage. This creates conflict of interest where the millers now tend to concentrate on sugar importation as opposed to sugar milling, to the detriment of the local sugar industry.” The report warns that a sizable amount of unaccustomed sugar is smuggled into the country through the porous borders, causing a distortion in the market, compromising quality and leads to loss of government revenue. The report recommends an enhanced inter-agency surveillance to curb smuggling.  --TheEastAfrican--
