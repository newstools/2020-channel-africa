The colonel's convoy was ambushed by militants on Sunday near Damboa, a few kilometres from Maiduguri, the main city in Borno state. He was evacuated to a hospital where he succumbed to his injuries on Monday. Army spokesperson, Ado Isa, said Col Bako was the commander of the 25 Task Force Brigade in Damboa, where the military is battling Boko Haram insurgents. He said Bako was "one of our gallant and finest war heroes". The army was however silent on the fate of the soldiers who were reportedly with Bako during the ambush. A military source told local media that six other soldiers died in the ambush. The Nigerian army has suffered numerous setbacks since the Boko Haram insurgency started in 2009. --BBC--
