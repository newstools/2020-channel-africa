The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned that Asia's economic growth will come to a halt in 2020, for the first time in 60 years - due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.  

Meanwhile criticism is mounting of United States (US) President, Donald Trump's decision to suspend funding for the World Health Organisation (WHO), over what he alleges is the WHO's initial covering up and mismanagement of the coronavirus pandemic. China says the WHO plays an indispensable role in the crisis and Washington should fulfil its obligations. Lawrence Gostin of the WHO says Trump may be pointing fingers to shift the focus from his administration's handling of the outbreak. --BBC--
