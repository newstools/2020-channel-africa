The order was announced on Saturday by the health ministry and took effect from Monday. In the capital Kigali, police could be seen questioning those with no face masks, but no arrests were made, reports BBC Great Lakes. Affordable masks are yet to hit the market in Rwanda although the government has announced a list of local companies allowed to make face masks. A middle-aged woman without a mask in the east of the capital told the BBC that she was waiting for affordable masks as those available are expensive. Under the lockdown, Rwandans are only allowed out of their homes for medical care, buying food, seeking financial services or to deliver those services. Over the weekend, the lockdown was extended by two more weeks to April 30. Rwanda has reported 147 cases of coronavirus and no deaths.
