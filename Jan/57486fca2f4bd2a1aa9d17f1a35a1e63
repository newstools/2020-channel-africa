The legendary striker, one of the best players ever to come out of Africa, retired from football in September last year after a glittering career that spanned more than two decades and involved him playing regularly in three different continents. But he says a lack of unity in Africa is one of the biggest causes of discord. Eto’o’s comments come at a time when racism is one of the hottest topics in world football. Several incidents across Europe marred the last few months of 2019, from England’s black players being mocked in Bulgaria to Italy’s treatment of some of the non-white players playing in Serie A. The 38-year-old says that even though white people had their differences when it comes to support for one another they stick together, something Africans never do. Eto’o was outspoken last year when Senegal’s Liverpool star Sadio Mane failed to win or even make the top three of European football’s biggest prize, the Ballon d’Or.
