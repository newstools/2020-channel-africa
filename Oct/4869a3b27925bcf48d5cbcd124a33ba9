In a press release, Wednesday, the committee said the per-liter prices of 80-octane, 92-octane, and 95-octane gasoline will be kept at LE 6.25, LE 7.50, and LE 8.50, respectively. Diesel fuel prices also remained untouched at LE 6.75 per liter. The committee said that the decision was taken after following up the price of oil worldwide, exchange rates and transportation, operation and production costs. Last April, Egypt's Fuel Automatic Pricing Committee decided, to decrease the fuel prices slightly by LE 0.25 per liter, following the exceptional circumstances that the global oil markets has been witnessing as a result of the emerging Coronavirus, COVID-19 crises. The ‘automatic pricing mechanism’ aims at adjusting the sale prices of some petroleum products in the local market every three months, based on two key determinants in the domestic market, namely Brent Crude oil price and the change in the value of the USD against the Egyptian pound, according to the statement. These two key determinants come beside other fixed charges and costs, which are being adjusted annually in September after the approval of the previous fiscal year budget by the Central Auditing Organization. Egypt has adopted the automatic pricing mechanism since last July aiming to provide flexibility to enable state institutions to provide the best service for all citizens.  --EgyptToday--
