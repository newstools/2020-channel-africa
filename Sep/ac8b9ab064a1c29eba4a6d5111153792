Three-time major champion Murray, 33, is one of three Britons in second-round action on day four at Flushing Meadows in New York, along with British number ones Johanna Konta and Dan Evans. Konta, who beat compatriot Heather Watson in the first round, plays Romania's Sorana Cirstea, before Evans takes on France’s Corentin Moutet. Both Cirstea and Moutet are ranked 77th in the women's and men's world rankings respectively. Murray played his first Grand Slam match in 20 months on Tuesday when he fought back from two sets and a break down to beat Japan’s Yoshihito Nishioka in a match that lasted four hours 39 minutes. "That was by far the most tennis I've played since the Aussie Open in 2019," said Murray, who is back playing after career-saving hip surgery. “I went in and asked to use the ice bath as soon as I got into the locker room and thankfully they allowed it because I needed it. “One of the benefits of being old as an athlete is that I have experience playing those sorts of matches and things I can do to help me recover better. I know I’ll need to get an early night’s sleep and try and sleep as much as I can.” --BBC--
