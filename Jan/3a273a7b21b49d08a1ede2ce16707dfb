Some of its flights from Johannesburg to the South African cities of Cape Town and Durban, and to Munich, Germany, were among those cancelled. In December, the airline entered bankruptcy protection. "These cancellations represent a responsible strategy to conserve cash and optimise the airline's position ahead of any further capital investment," SAA said in a statement. It said it will be reviewing further "possible flight schedule amendments" over the coming days.
