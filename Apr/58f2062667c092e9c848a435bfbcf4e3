In a statement, the bank said the economy was expected to recover moderately in 2021. Last yearâ€™s contraction was caused by a drought and falling output in sectors such as construction and retail, while this year the economic shutdown to tackle COVID-19 has hit tourism and damaged other sectors. The virus has so far only infected 16 people and caused no deaths in the country. --Reuters--
