The world’s biggest maker of mobile telecommunications equipment and smartphones is under pressure from United States (US) trade curbs designed to choke Huawei’s access to commercially available chips. “The US has modified their sanctions for the third time and that has indeed brought great challenges to our production and operations,” Huawei Chairman Guo Ping told reporters in Shanghai. Washington says Huawei is a vehicle for Chinese state espionage and from September 15 imposed new curbs barring US companies from supplying or servicing the company. Huawei has repeatedly denied being a national security risk. Guo said that although Huawei had sufficient chips for its business-to-business operations, including its 5G network enterprise, it was feeling the pinch of the U.S. restrictions on its smartphone chip stocks.  

It understood that suppliers such as Qualcomm were applying for US licences which would allow them to continue serving Huawei, he added. Intel has already received licences to supply certain products to Huawei, while China’s Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp, which uses US-origin machinery to produce chips for Huawei, has applied for a licence, Reuters has previously reported.
