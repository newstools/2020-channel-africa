Ewers, a former Hillcrest School student, helped his side capture the 2020 European Rugby Championship. Luke-Cowan Dickie, Sam Simmonds and Harry Williams powered over to give Exeter a nine-point lead at the break. Racing roared back with Simon Zebo’s second try and Camille Chat’s surge brought them to within a point with Exeter, down to 14 men, after Tomas Francis’ late yellow card. An intense final 10 minutes saw Racing turning down the drop-goal opportunity, as they went through the phases, within five metres of the line. Exeter replacement, Sam Hidalgo-Clyne, secured a turnover, under the shadow of his posts and captain, Joe Simmonds, landed a penalty with the last act of the match.  --Herald--
