The operation started on Friday, but was slowed down because of rough sea conditions during the weekend. The MV Wakashio's stem is no longer visible on the sea surface, the National Crisis Committee confirmed to the BBC. Pumping operations to remove the remaining diesel oil in the engine room of the aft have also been completed. The ship hit a coral reef on July 25 while carrying 4,000 tonnes of fuel oil. Most of the oil on board was pumped out before the ship broke apart at the weekend but nearly 1,000 tonnes leaked into the sea causing damage to the rich marine ecosystem. --BBC--
