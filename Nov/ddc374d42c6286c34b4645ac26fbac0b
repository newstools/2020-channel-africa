The teachers were kidnapped on Tuesday in front of their students, according to Rev Fonki Samuel Foba who supervises Presbyterian schools in the country, including this one in Kumbo. He said the attackers initially took 12 teachers but that one of the teachers escaped along the way. The identity of the gunmen remains unclear, but local government authorities are blaming English-speaking separatists for the kidnapping. The incident comes a little more than a week after seven children were killed in an attack on a private school in Kumba in the South-West region. Both the North-West and South-West regions of Cameroon have been in the grips of a separatist conflict for the past four years. Schools in those regions have been closed during much of the crisis due to safety concerns. --BBC--
