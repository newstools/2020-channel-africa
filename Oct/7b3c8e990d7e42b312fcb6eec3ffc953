The last time the two teams met was earlier this year, when Amakhosi beat Pirates 1-0, before the coronavirus outbreak. Pirates coach, Josef Zinnbauer says despite the absence of spectators, the scales will be equal. Pirates welcome Chiefs for the much-anticipated match scheduled for Orlando Stadium on Saturday. It’s time for redemption as German coach, Josef Zinnbauer prepares Pirates for the mainstay match. Zinnbauer was subjected to a baptism of fire by arch-rivals Chiefs, three months after signing with Pirates. He has a chance to bounce back when the two sides meet again this weekend. The coach says it would benefit his team if the fans were at the stadium. “I think it is an advantage for us when we have a home game and we have the supporters in 100% (sic) but we cannot change the situation. All teams play without supporters. We have to focus on this match, but we have to accept this.” Pirates have had a good record when pitted against Amakhosi in the MTN-8 tournament. In the 2010/2011 season Pirates edged out Chiefs in the second leg with a solitary goal to win the semifinal tie 2-1 on aggregate. In the 2012/2013 season, Pirates won the first leg 1-0 with the second leg ending in a draw. Bucs went on to win 2-1 on aggregate to advance to the final. Zinnbauer says pressure is on both teams. “We are not the favourites. We have pressure. Kaizer Chiefs have the pressure in this game, but we will do our best. We have to win the game. That’s important for us. It’s a derby and it’s a big chance you can win a cup.” Pirates have played three matches so far this season. Amabhakabhaka beat Cape Town City in the MTN8 and went on to draw against AmaZulu 1-all before drawing against Stellenbosch FC by the same scoreline. But the coach says it’s not easy to stick to continuity when they play six matches in 20 days. --sabc--
