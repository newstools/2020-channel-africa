The South African national football team continues to have more downs than ups in recent years. Bafana Bafana have also slumped from being second on the continent and 25th internationally to their current-day position of 13th and 71st, respectively. Their fortunes also continue to fluctuate, although hopes have been raised with a new coach Molefi Ntseki now in charge. But Eto’o, one of Africa’s finest sons, believes they should be doing a lot better. Bafana Bafana have not qualified for the World Cup for 17 years, although they did play in the 2010 event by virtue of being hosts. That was only their third-ever appearance in the finals as one of the continent’s financial powerhouses continues to perennially fall short. Nonetheless, Eto’o is hopeful that will all change in the coming years. The former Barcelona and Inter Milan striker is, however, optimistic of the game in general across the African continent. He says that all the signs point towards a more positive outlook in the future. Eto’o is also upbeat about the future of his own national football team, the Indomitable Lions. The former striker, who played 118 times for Cameroon between 1997 and 2014 scoring a record 56 goals, helped his country become a powerhouse on the continent during his playing days. He twice won the Africa Cup of Nations with them and also played in four World Cups. However, the west Africans have been in decline since his retirement. But he is hopeful that the good times will return, starting with the next Afcon that Cameroon will host in 2021.
