The downing of Ukraine International Airlines flight 752, which killed all 176 people aboard, has created a new crisis for the Islamic Republic’s clerical rulers. President, Hassan Rouhani, promised a thorough investigation into the “unforgivable error” in an address on Tuesday. It was the latest in a series of apologies by the leadership that has done little to quell public anger. Britain, France and Germany also increased diplomatic pressure on Iran, launching a dispute mechanism to challenge Tehran for breaching limits on its nuclear program under an agreement which Washington abandoned in 2018. Tehran has faced an escalating confrontation with the West and a wave of unrest since the United States (US) killed Iran’s most powerful military commander in a drone strike on January 3. Iran shot down the plane when its military was on high alert, hours after firing missiles at US targets in Iraq. It admitted the mistake on Saturday after days of denials. New security camera footage shows two missiles, fired 30 seconds apart, hitting the plane after take-off, the New York Times reported on Tuesday. US intelligence officials said on January 9 that the heat signatures of two surface-to-air missiles were detected near the aircraft. Iranian Judiciary Spokesman, Gholamhossein Esmaili, said some of those accused of having a role in the plane disaster had been arrested, although he did not say how many or identify them. Since the official admission, protesters, many of them students, have held daily demonstrations, chanting “Clerics get lost!” and calling for the removal of Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in power for more than 30 years. --Reuters--
