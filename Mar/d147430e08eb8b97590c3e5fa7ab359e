Pick n Pay said in a statement that all their actions are geared to supporting the health and well-being of their customers and staff.  
They are following the guidance provided by the Presidency, the advice of the South African Department of Health and the expert guidance issued by the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD).   

They have been preparing for the coronavirus for some weeks, working closely with their suppliers to make sure they have stocks in their stores and that customers can get what they want and need. Customers should be assured that they have a very good relationship with suppliers, and that they will have stocks available in their stores." On stock piling, Pick n Pay said that their customers have been buying responsibly for the most part, stocking up on what they usually buy. "Understandably, as they read and act on the advice they are receiving, they are buying more household cleaning and personal hygiene products, and dry groceries, and we’ve seen demand for these products increase over the past week.  

We would like to encourage our customers to continue shopping responsibly. Where stocks are temporarily low due to heavy customer demand, we will be limiting the number of certain products per customer." Pick n Pay that the limits on certain products will have signage in-store and online will guide them on what these are. The retailer also said that they would not be increasing the prices of the key products. Pick n Pay said that they have seen an increase in their online purchasing in the past 10 days. "Our online service is operating effectively. Our technology systems are more than able to cope with increased activity online."
