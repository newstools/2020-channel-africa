Nadal added two Grand Slam titles to his total last year to move to 19, one behind his Swiss rival, and at the age of 33 looks as hungry as ever to add to his tally. The Mallorcan reached the final in Melbourne last year, losing to Serbian Novak Djokovic who is third on the all-time list with 16 and who will be many people’s favourite to maintain his domination of the Australian Open as he has triumphed seven times at Melbourne Park. While Nadal is never one to talk up the prospect of overtaking Federer, Corretja says the fact he has closed to within one for the first time in his career is significant. “It’s a huge motivation for him I’m sure,” former world number two Corretja, who will be part of broadcaster Eurosport’s team of analysts in Melbourne, told Reuters on Tuesday. “He is so humble (that) he’s (probably) not even thinking of the future. But I’m sure in the back of his mind he knows that now he has a great chance in 2020and in the next four Slams to tie Roger and even go ahead of him.” Nadal suffered with injury problems and a loss of form and confidence after last year’s Australian Open, but has hit back with a vengeance and, according to Corretja, has another three years in which he can win Grand Slam titles. “Last year he won two Slams, reached the finals in Australia and semis in Wimbledon, that means he is going to be knocking on the door for next two or three years for sure,” he said.
