Ten years later, many fear Conde, who turns 82 next week, is laying the groundwork to cling to power himself by holding a referendum on Sunday that could extend his rule for 12 more years, risking mass unrest and the health of the mining economy. The new constitution would impose a limit of two six-year terms, up from the current two five-year terms. It does not specify whether terms served under the previous constitution would count, but Conde has suggested they would not. At least 30 people have died since October in protests against the proposed constitutional changes and many are bracing for more trouble on Sunday.  

The outcome could be a bellwether for a presidential election before year’s end in the country, the largest African producer of the main aluminum ore, bauxite. The opposition is boycotting the referendum and simultaneous legislative elections, which it says will be a sham, and leading members have said they will prevent voting, without saying how. In the capital Conakry this week, pick-ups full of police and soldiers patrolled the streets past billboards urging people to vote yes. 

The government ordered schools closed for several days, and residents of opposition strongholds were stocking up on food.
