If investors refuse Zambia’s request for a six-month standstill in a key vote on Tuesday, it may become the first African nation to default since the onset of the coronavirus. That could set a precedent for how cash-strapped governments treat private and Chinese creditors. The southern African nation isn’t making it any easier for bondholders to give it breathing space. Days after the government said it didn’t have the cash, it skipped a $42.5 million coupon payment, only for Finance Minister Bwalya Ng’andu to tell lawmakers the Treasury could have paid if it wanted to. That may leave investors doubting the government’s will to tackle its debt problems in the run-up to elections in August. “Zambia may very well be the most prominent battleground that this tension between creditors plays out,” said Irmgard Erasmus, an economist at Paarl, South Africa-based NKC Africa Economics. “Eurobond holders, in particular, are certain to use all the weapons in their arsenal to limit moral hazard to the rest of sub-Saharan Africa, said Erasmus”. A group that holds about 40% of Zambia’s $3 billion in outstanding Eurobonds has already said it won’t support the proposal. The government has a 30-day grace period to make the interest payment it missed last week before a default event occurs, which would allow bondholders to demand immediate repayment of the principal. --Bloomberg--
