South Africa’s Crop Estimates Committee (CEC) is expected to forecast this year’s maize production at 15.574 million tons, up from 11.275 million harvested in the 2018/2019 season, which was impacted by dry weather conditions, an average estimate by five traders and analysts showed. The estimate is slightly lower than the CEC’s May forecast of 15.589 million tons. Estimates ranged from 15.3 million to 15.72 million tons. The crop is expected to consist of 9.182 million tons of white maize used mainly for human consumption, and 6.394 million tons of yellow maize used mainly in animal feed. The CEC will give its fifth production forecast for the 2019/2020 summer crops on Thursday. --Reuters--
