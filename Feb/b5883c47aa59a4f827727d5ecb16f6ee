Amazon said "due to the outbreak and continued concerns about novel coronavirus" it would no longer take part in Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. But it admitted other companies are considering whether to attend. South Korea's LG Electronics, Ericsson, the Swedish telecoms equipment-maker, and United States (US) chip company NVIDIA have already withdrawn from the conference which runs between February 24 to 27. The GSMA, which organises the show in the Spanish city, said that while it could "confirm some large exhibitors have decided not to come to the show this year with others still contemplating next steps, we remain more than 2 800 exhibitors strong". However, it revealed that it had put in place additional measures to "reassure attendees and exhibitors that their health and safety are our paramount concern.
