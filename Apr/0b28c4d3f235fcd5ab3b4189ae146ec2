Former world No 1 Wozniacki retired from professional tennis after this year's Australian Open, but she had announced back in December that she would face the 23-time Grand Slam winner in her final match. Dubbed "The Final One 2020", the event was set to take place at the Royal Arena in Copenhagen on May 18, but it has been postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic. Former Australian Open champion Wozniacki made the announcement on Twitter, writing: "I am sad to announce that my final match against Serena Williams has been postponed. "Safety and health of everyone is most important! We will be rescheduling for a later date, and will let everyone know as soon as we have one confirmed!"
