The stringent measure had caused an outcry after families were forced to hold night burials to beat the deadline. Patrick Amoth, the Ministry's Director General, has said there was no need for rushed burials if the dead bodies were treated well. "If you look at the transmission of Covid-19 against other infections, there is very little likelihood that one stands a chance of getting infected from a body, if treated well," he said. Since the start of the pandemic, local administrators have been enforcing the rule regardless of the cause of death. The latest incident happened last week in the lakeside town of Kisumu, where fans of a local musician clashed with police while protesting against his rushed burial. The Government has been accused of enforcing rules selectively after a huge number of mourners, who included Health Ministry officials, attended a funeral in Nyeri, in central Kenya, defying recommendations for few people to attend such gatherings. --BBCâ€”
