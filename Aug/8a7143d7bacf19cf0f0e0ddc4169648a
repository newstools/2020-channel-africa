The recently arrested inmates were tested whilst in quarantine before being transferred to the prison in Amuru District, which borders South Sudan. The Uganda Prisons Service has asked the government to test the country's more than 60,000 inmates and wardens. The facilities are extremely overcrowded and often hold three times the intended capacity. Uganda now has more than 2,200 known cases of coronavirus. --BBC--
