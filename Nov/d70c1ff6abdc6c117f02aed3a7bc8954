Zimbabwe has a decentralised SEPs ownership model, where the government shareholder function is spread across different line ministries. The ownership model has been associated with a number of challenges, including inconsistencies in governance practices, ministerial interferences, delays and or reversals of Government approved SEPs reforms due to vested interests within some line ministries, and generally weak and passive oversight function, among others. Under the centralised ownership model, a single government institution carries out the role as shareholder in all companies controlled by the State. Ncube said the new model had already been approved by the cabinet and would be implemented next year. “In line with international best practices, government took a deliberate decision to review the SEPs ownership model,” said Ncube in the 2021 National Budget statement presented yesterday. “Following approval by Cabinet, implementation of the new ownership model will also be one of the central SOEs reforms to be implemented in the 2021 fiscal year.” Ncube said the current model had been related to the poor performance of the SOEs sector not only in Zimbabwe, but the world over, wherever this model had been followed. As such, many countries in the region, such as South Africa, Mozambique, and more recently, Namibia and Zambia; as well as those on the continent and beyond, such as China, Malaysia, France, have migrated from the decentralised ownership model in favour of centralised or dual ownership models. --Herald--
