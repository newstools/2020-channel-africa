The postponement comes after attacks in north Darfur at a settlement for internally displaced people that left nine people dead and 16 wounded. Clashes between security forces and groups protesting the violence had earlier led to a declaration of a state of emergency in the region. Rebel groups participating in the peace talks blame the transitional government and the state's authorities for failing to deal with militias in the region, according to media reports. The rebel groups under the Revolutionary Front Alliance, who are participating in peace talks with the Sudanese government in the South Sudanese capital Juba, have demanded an investigation into the attacks and the protection of citizens. The peace talks incorporate rebel groups operating in Darfur, Blue Nile and South Kordofan regions which had been fighting the government of former President, Omar al-Bashir, before his overthrow in April 2019. --BBC--
