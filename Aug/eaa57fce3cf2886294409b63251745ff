The country descended into civil war after the 2010 election, when Gbagbo refused to step down and hand over to the victor Alassane Ouattara. Last year he was acquitted by the International Criminal Court of crimes against humanity and currently lives in Belgium pending a possible appeal by the prosecution. He was sentenced in absentia by an Ivorian court to a 20-year term for looting a regional bank during the 2010 post-election crisis. --BBC--
