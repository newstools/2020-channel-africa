Defence officials initially said five civilians died after being accidentally caught in crossfire between the military and separatist rebels in the western village of Ngarbuh. However human rights groups said Cameroonian soldiers and armed ethnic Fulani went from house to house shooting dead the residents, including 13 children. President Paul Biya ordered an investigation into the incident after several countries, including the United States and France, condemned the killings. Several Cameroonian soldiers are still on trial accused of executing two women and their two young children in 2015. It was the subject of BBC Africa Eye investigation.
