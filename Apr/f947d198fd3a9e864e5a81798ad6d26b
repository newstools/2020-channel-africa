The company has suffered a 7% drop in first-quarter output of platinum group metals (PGM) to 954,800 ounces, with 61,000 PGM ounces lost at its South African operations alone, hit by a coronavirus lockdown that started on March 27 and has been extended until May. Amplats said it will seek capital expenditure reductions that support the updated production profile while ensuring long-term asset integrity. It will make further savings from cost cuts and reductions overtime payments and production bonuses for employees not at work. Another member of the Anglo American group, Kumba Iron Ore, said it is also targeting cost savings, aiming for a total of $17  million , and would defer non-critical capital expenditure of 1 billion rand to bolster its financial position. “These cash-preservation measures add to our liquidity position, which remains at levels similar to that at the end of 2019,” Kumba said. --Reuters--
