According to motorsport.com, both Hamilton and Vettel have contracts on the table and it is now up to the two to decide if they want to stay at Mercedes and Ferrari respectively. "Several rumours collected in the last few days confirm that both Lewis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel will have to communicate their intentions to their respective teams by the end of April, confirming or not the conditions agreed in the negotiations that have already carried out," the Italian publication reports. "There is apparently no hurry, but in reality there are mechanisms that put pressure on the top teams." Those pressures are finding top drivers to replace them if they opt not to resign. Vettel's new contract is believed to be a one-year deal, and one that comes with a drastic pay cut. Should the German decide that it is not for him, Daniel Ricciardo and Carlos Sainz are leading the running to replace him. In which case both would need to enter negotiations with Ferrari, as well as their current teams - Renault and McLaren - and then decide. Sainz reportedly already has a new contract from McLaren on the table so Ferrari need an answer from Vettel sooner rather than later if they want to chase the Spaniard's signature. --News24â€”
