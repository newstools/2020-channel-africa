While the future of sport in South Africa is uncertain given the ongoing fight against the coronavirus, the third edition of the MSL is set to take place at the end of 2020. It is understood that the decision to expand the tournament from six franchises to eight, including new sides from East London and Bloemfontein, is being strongly considered by Cricket South Africa (CSA). In its current format, the MSL has seen the Cape Town Blitz, Paarl Rocks, Jozi Stars, Nelson Mandela Bay Giants, Tshwane Spartans and Durban Heat do battle. The tournament, under the previous CSA leadership of suspended Chief Executive Officer(CEO) Thabang Moroe, was considered vital in CSA's efforts to improve their financial position. The absence of a major broadcast deal, however, meant that the tournament has not been the money spinner CSA had hoped it would be. The first two editions have been broadcast free-to-air on SABC, but a report from Cricinfo on Wednesday suggested that it could be making its way onto pay channel SuperSport from 2020 and that negotiations are currently taking place to make that happen. --News24--
