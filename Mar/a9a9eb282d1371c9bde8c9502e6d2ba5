Brent crude LCOc1 futures had fallen $1.45, or 5.4%, to $25.53 a barrel by 1149 GMT.Â 

West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures were down 41 cents, or 1.8%, at $22.22 a barrel, having fallen 2% points more than Brent this year. The demand destruction caused by the coronavirus pandemic comes as the oil market contends with the unexpected price war that erupted between producers Russia and Saudi Arabia, effectively ending an OPEC+ alliance and flooding the market with barrels.
