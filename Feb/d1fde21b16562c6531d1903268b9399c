But the Daily Monitor adds that they used the wrong ingredients, mistaking a pesticide, used to grow watermelons and vegetables, for cooking oil. The children then started vomiting, the news site reports, and were taken to Busolwe hospital where two of them died and the 11 others are being treated.
