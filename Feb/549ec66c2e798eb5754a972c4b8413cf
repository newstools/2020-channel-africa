There has been a national recall in South Africa of the product following a defect in the cans that can be harmful to consumers. General Manager for Food and Associated Industries at NRCS, Meisie Katz, says there have been no reported fatalities in regard to the defect. “We are currently involving the EHP’s in terms of the department of health to assist us with the informal market.” The NRCS has recalled products manufactured at the West Point Processors last year after it became apparent the tins leaked after a few months. Katz, says the majority of products in the wholesale and commercial market has already been collected.
