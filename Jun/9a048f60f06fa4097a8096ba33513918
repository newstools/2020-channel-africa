Plenty came close however, with seven players tied on six-under 65 and another six on five-under par 66. "Any time you shoot seven-under par around this golf course, it's obviously a pretty solid day," said Poulter, who won the last of his three United States (US) PGA Tour titles at the 2018 Houston Open. "It's very important being bogey-free. It's a fiddly, testing, tricky golf course," Poulter added of the par-71 layout. Poulter said he needed to improve off the tee, but his solid iron play included a 213-yard five-iron to five feet for a birdie at 18, and he didn't miss a putt from within 10 feet. The highlight for Hubbard, whose best PGA Tour finish was a tie for second at the Houston Open earlier this season, was a 10-foot eagle on the second hole. South Africa's Dylan Frittelli, Colombia's Sebastian Munoz, Norway's Viktor Hovland and Americans Webb Simpson, Michael Thompson, Brice Garnett and Ryan Palmer shared third on 65. Three-time major winner Jordan Spieth was the unlikely leader of the group on five-under par 66, overcoming a triple-bogey at his third hole, the 12, with eight birdies - seven of them on his second nine. "It's not a great feeling," Spieth said of finding himself three over through three holes after going right off the tee at 12. --News24--
