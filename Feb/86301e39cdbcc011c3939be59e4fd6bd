Heathrow also on Wednesday reported adjusted core earnings of 1.9 billion pounds ($2.47 billion) for 2019, up 4.6%, on revenues that rose 3.4% to 3.1 billion pounds, boosted by higher passenger numbers. The airport has a project to build a third runway, which it says it can do without compromising environmental targets, but the expansion is subject to a legal challenge. Heathrow has warned that France's hub airport Charles de Gaulle is set to overtake Heathrow as the busiest airport in Europe in the next two years. Holland-Kaye said that building the new runway will help boost United Kingdom trade links. Heathrow Airport is owned by Ferrovial, Qatar Investment Authority and China Investment Corp, among others.
