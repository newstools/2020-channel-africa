It was a dramatic reversal of fortune for the incumbent, Peter Mutharika, whose victory in a May 2019 ballot was overturned by the Constitutional Court over fraud allegations. Chakwera, a former evangelist preacher, was declared the winner of the election replay held on Tuesday with almost 59% of the vote, according to results announced late on Saturday. Malawi is only the second African country south of the Sahara to have presidential poll results overturned in court, after Kenya in 2017. It is the first time in the region that a vote re-run has led to the defeat of an incumbent leader. "I do solemnly swear that I will well and truly perform the functions of the high office of the president of the Republic of Malawi and that I will preserve and defend the constitution," the 65-year-old Chakwera said as took his oath before thousands of supporters. Opposition candidate Saulos Chilima was sworn in as vice-president. --AFP--
