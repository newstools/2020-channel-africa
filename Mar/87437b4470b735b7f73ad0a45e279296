Lieutenant Colonel, Leroy Brewer's killing was "senseless" and a "huge loss", Police Chief General, Khehla Sithole said. He had "always excelled in cracking complex cases, particularly related to rhino poaching", General Sithole added. South Africa has seen a fall in poaching in recent years after stepping up efforts to protect the animals. A total of 594 rhinos were killed for their horns in 2019, compared with 769 in 2018 and 1 028 in 2017, official statistics show. Rhino horns are in huge demand in Asian states such as China and Vietnam, where they are used in traditional medicines. Most of the poaching takes place in the world-famous Kruger National Park, which borders Mozambique, according to campaign group Save the Rhino. --BBC--
