Captain Eoin Morgan smashed a 33-ball 66 and Dawid Malan was 55 not out as England completed their third highest chase with five balls to spare. The pair put on 112 from 62 deliveries after England had lost openers Jonny Bairstow and Tom Banton in successive balls to leg-spinner Shadab Khan. With 18 needed England briefly stuttered, losing Morgan and Moeen Ali in the space of six balls, but the composed Malan saw them home. It was another fine batting performance from England's white-ball outfit - the highest chase by any side against Pakistan in T20s. It also made up for a ragged bowling performance which allowed Mohammad Hafeez to propel Pakistan to 195-4 with 69 from 36 balls. England, who have won their past five T20 series, will take a 1-0 lead into Tuesday's series finale at the same ground. --BBC--
