The powerful military force in Libya loyal to the eastern-based commander Khalifa Haftar has dismissed Friday's announcement of a ceasefire by the UN-backed government based in Tripoli. The spokesperson for General Haftar's LNA said the declaration was a media stunt. He said the LNA was ready to respond to any attack by government forces on its positions around the city of Sirte. Fighting in Libya between the two factions has gone relatively quiet in the past two months, but previous ceasefire attempts have fallen apart with each side accusing the other of violating agreements. --BBC--
