"There were warning shots. The police intervened to clear the barricades and disperse the demonstrators," Oumar Camara, a local resident, is quoted as saying to Reuters. It comes after the election commission released preliminary results of Sunday's presidential vote from 37 of the 38 districts. Those results show the incumbent Alpha Cond√© won around twice as many votes as Diallo. Diallo has complained of large-scale fraud and declared himself the winner. The government has ordered the army to restore order following violent protests over the election results. At least nine people have died in the latest violence. --BBC--
