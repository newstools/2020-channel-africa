With the sporting world in limbo amidst the global fight against the coronavirus, South Africa's national cricketers face uncertain times in the weeks and months to come. The Proteas are set to tour Sri Lanka for a limited overs series in June and then the West Indies for two Tests in July, but both of those tours are in doubt. The 2020 edition of cricket's most lucrative product was due to get underway on March 29 and was then suspended until April 15, but the latest word is that it has now been postponed indefinitely. Ngidi was due to turn out for the Chennai Super Kings, but there is no way of knowing when the tournament will be staged. The absence of sport is having a significant financial impact on players, sponsors, unions and broadcasters, but Ngidi has urged South Africans to put things into perspective. "All we can do is wait. The safety of humanity comes first and cricket comes second," he said on Thursday. "All I can say to fellow South Africans and sports followers is that patience is what is going to help us in this time period. Rushing something like this is not going to help us in any way moving forward. --News24--
