Governments are looking at ways to ease any shortage, including “green lanes” to allow fresh produce to move quickly across European Union (EU) borders, recruiting a “shadow army” of harvesters and loosening travel rules for migrant workers. While Europe’s supermarkets say they are still getting most produce, supply pressures are building at source, including in Africa, a key provider of fresh goods, and within Europe. Stores that are already dealing with hoarding by customers may struggle to keep shelves stocked. In Kenya, a major supplier of green beans and peas to Europe, half of the workers in the sector have been sent home on mandatory leave because of the industry’s inability to ship orders, even as demand from European retailers surge.

“Their (European) stocks are being depleted by the day,” said Okisegere Ojepat, chief executive of the Fresh Produce Consortium of Kenya which groups over 200 growers and exporters. Shipments from another key supplier, South Africa, are becoming more challenging with the country set to begin a 21-day lockdown this week.
