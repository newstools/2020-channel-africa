With the rise of Uber, government has, on occasion, expressed a need for intervention and more clarity regulating the business' operations. However, the regulations first touted in 2017 have not been forthcoming until now. According to a tweet posted by the Transport Minister on Monday, South Africa will follow the lead of other countries that have started regulating Uber and other players in the sector. Mentioning existing National Land Transport Act of 2009, which was in the process of being amended, Mbalula said the new regulations would soon fill the gap that existed when controlling ride hailing services and their operations in South Africa.

Mbalula was also foreshadowing a briefing on the amendments, set to take place in Cape Town on Tuesday morning. In 2019 Uber lost its licence to operate in London, England, after concerns of substandard safety standards.

--News24-- UBER, Taxify, BOLT and others will be regulated by Government.These amendments seek to provide for e-haling services regulation, also to empower provinces to undertake new contracts which was absent in the principle act. Will explain more on this tomorrow: https://t.co/0Dvkd2k5zO
