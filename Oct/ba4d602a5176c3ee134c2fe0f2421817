Speaking during an emergency meeting with government heads of departments in Chobe, Manake, said the outbreak of locusts was a national disaster that needed a multi-sectoral approach. She expressed fear that should the locusts become out of control, they would cause panic for wild animals in the park and worsen the already existing human and wildlife conflict because animals might seek refuge in residential areas. Manake further said the outbreak was a threat to the country's food security, adding that with the COVID-19 pandemic, it was imperative for every country to sustain itself in terms of food. She said, since the outbreak of locusts had been declared a national emergency in other neighbouring countries, it meant that Botswana was on the receiving end and fear was that the Chobe River was likely to hamper efforts to fight locusts. Chobe District agricultural coordinator, Seeng Manne, said the most affected area was the Enclave with nymphs and adult locusts that had not reached maturity stage. Manne said the challenge of controlling the locust was that it was migratory, adding that if not controlled it had potential to destroy a total 139 hectares. She said already a total of 3.8 hectares of germinating maize in Mabele and Satau areas had been affected by the locusts. --AllAfrica--
