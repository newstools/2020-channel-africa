Jakobsen, born to an Egyptian father and a Danish mother, is Zamalek’s second signing this summer after the Tunisian defender, Hamza Al Mathlouthi.

Jakobsen was part of the Egyptian team that won the 2013 African U-20 Championship and he also represented Egypt’s first team in one friendly match against Togo.

In an exclusive interview with Egypt Today in 2017, Jakobsen said “You never know what will happen in the future, maybe one day I might come and play in Egypt.” After three years, Jakobsen signed for one of the biggest clubs in the country, Zamalek.

The signing of Alexander Jakobsen comes as part of Zamalek’s efforts to strengthen the team squad to challenge for titles next season.

The White Knights suffered a tough week after losing the CAF Champions League title on Friday to arch-rivals, Al Ahly.

Zamalek also were knocked out of the Egyptian Cup after losing on Tuesday to El Geish and finish the season title-less. --EgyptToday--
