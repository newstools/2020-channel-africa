McIlroy would have arrived at Augusta National in April as the firm favourite after seven straight top-five finishes around the world, only for the major championship to be postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic. But renowned golf instructor Harmon reckons it's only a matter of time before McIlroy finishes the job and clinches the final major he needs to complete the Grand Slam. The world number one posted five straight top-10 finishes at Augusta before placing just outside the top 20 in 2019, and when asked if McIlroy will go on to win the Masters, Harmon told Sky Sports News: "Absolutely, I don't see how he can't. His game is suited for it and it's the one he wants to win. "I think if he can just relax and allow himself to play golf, then as world number one to say he's never going to win the Masters is ridiculous. I think for sure he'll win it and when he wins one, he'll win more than one." Virtually the entire golfing schedule has been wiped out until late May at the earliest, but Harmon hopes the second half of the year is filled with as much golf as possible - the Masters included. "I thought it was interesting when they decided not to cancel the event (the Masters), just to postpone it," Harmon added. "It sure would be nice to have it, but I think we'll just have to wait and see. "I think if we are able to play golf then we should play the Ryder Cup, we should play The Open and play all the events we can, if and when the severity of this terrible virus passes. Â
