South Africa’s Crop Estimates Committee (CEC) is expected to forecast maize production at 14.959 million tons for the crop to be harvested in 2020, up from the 11.259 million tons planted last season, an average estimated by five traders and analysts showed. Refinitiv Agriculture Research data pegs the harvest at 14.1 million tons. The range of the survey of total maize estimates was between 14.5 million tons to 15.4 million tons. The survey showed the crop is expected to consist of 8.672 million tons of white maize used mainly for human consumption, and 6.287 million tons of yellow maize used mainly in animal feed. The harvest is expected to be 2.7% higher than the CEC’s February’s estimate of 14.560 million tons. “It is very fortunate to harvest crop like this, which has helped farmers with their cash flow and as a result cattle prices have increased,” said Wessel Lemmer, an Agricultural Economist with Absa. --Reuters--
