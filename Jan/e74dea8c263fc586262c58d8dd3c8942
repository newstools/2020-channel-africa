In 2019, Mercedes promoted Ricciardo Musconi, Hamilton's second engineer, to the role of primary race engineer for Valtteri Bottas. Hamilton, who ultimately won his sixth world championship in 2019, toldÂ Auto Motor und Sport: "It certainly didn't help. You have to work hard to build a relationship of trust with your engineers, and with Bono and the other engineers, we have grown into a really good team. "Ricky is a very talented engineer so it's obvious that he wants to go places, and there was an opportunity on the other car. But I must have gotten more out of him than he realised, and vice versa." Hamilton claims that Bottas' early-season form in 2019, dubbed by many as 'Bottas 2.0', was in part due to Musconi's switch. He said: "If he suddenly works on the other car, he'll say 'Listen Valtteri, we did it this way and that way with Lewis'. And his team is now doing things very much like mine."
