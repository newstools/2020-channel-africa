Kevin De Bruyne and Robert Lewandowski are now set to battle it out for the individual prize. Ronaldo, who plies his trade in Italy with Juventus, has picked up the accolade on three occasions and also has a total of nine nominations to his name. Barcelona superstar Messi has won it two times and made the final short-list in six of the last 10 seasons. Both men have stood out as the best players of their generation for well over a decade, but as they continue to advance into their thirties, an inevitable changing of the guard is beginning to take shape. Juventus exited the Champions League at the last 16 last season, after a surprise defeat to Lyon, while Barca were knocked out in humiliating fashion in the last eight by eventual winners Bayern. Ronaldo only managed three goals in eight appearances and Messi recorded three strikes in the same number of matches, with Lewandowski ultimately finishing as the competition’s top scorer with 15 to his name. The Bayern striker is now in line to win the coveted Player of the Year award alongside Manchester City’s De Bruyne and Allianz Arena team-mate Manuel Neuer, who recorded a clean sheet in the final victory over Paris Saint-Germain on August 23.  --Herald--
