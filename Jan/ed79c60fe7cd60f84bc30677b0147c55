Aubameyang, who took over the captain’s armband in November following Granit Xhaka’s fallout with the Arsenal faithful, has been heavily linked with a move away from North London. Arsenal have endured a difficult season and currently occupy 10th place in the English Premier League, a massive 37 points behind leaders Liverpool. The 30-year-old has still managed to find the back of the net regularly this season and is the club’s top scorer with 16 goals in 26 appearances across all competitions. Aubameyang missed Arsenal’s two most recent league encounters following his sending off away to Crystal Palace and is also suspended for tonight’s FA Cup clash away to Bournemouth. In total, the speedy forward has 57 goals in 91 games for Arsenal. --AllAfrica--
