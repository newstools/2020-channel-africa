The country is endowed with vast mineral resources ranging from gold, platinum, diamonds and chrome among others. This falls well into the country’s agenda of achieving a $12 billion revenue sector by 2023. According to the Mineral Potential Index of 2019, Zimbabwe is among the top African countries with great geological potential, as viewed by investors, a situation that the Government can exploit for the sector’s further growth which should cascade to communities. The Mineral Potential Index, together with the Policy Perception Index forms the Investment Attractiveness Index that is carried out by Canadian think tank, Fraser Institute. The annual Investment Attractiveness Index is an attempt to assess how mineral endowments and public policy factors such as taxation and regulatory framework encourage or discourage mining investment. Tax Justice Network Africa (TJNA) advisor on tax and natural resources governance, Mukasiri Sibanda, said this could be an opportunity to improve other areas Zimbabwe is lagging behind, such as policy perception, to enhance its attractiveness and boost foreign direct investment. African countries that were deemed to be very attractive according to the 2019 annual survey are Zimbabwe and DRC. --Herald--
