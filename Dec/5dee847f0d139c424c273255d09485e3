SoftBank’s shares are seen as chronically undervalued by company executives, with debate around the benefits of a buyout intensifying as they plunged to lows in March 2020. Record share buybacks and a string of asset sales have driven a 180% share price gain since then, giving the group a market capitalization of around $140 billion and raising the hurdle for a buyout. Management buyouts remain rare in Japan, where being listed is a mark of status for companies, and any move to take SoftBank private faces considerable internal opposition.

Son owns a quarter of SoftBank’s shares and would need to lift his shareholding ratio to two thirds to squeeze out minority shareholders. SoftBank was not immediately reachable for comment. The group has raised $80 billion through asset sales causing speculation about how Son, who is said to prefer buying over selling, will deploy the cash pile.
