The firm has partnered with national government administration officers to enhance public awareness on the danger of unsafe use or accidental contact with electricity. “Through the partnership, the company is aiming to educate the public on how to prevent electrical accidents and the channels for reporting accidents and unsafe situations in a timely manner,” said Kenya Power Managing Director, Bernard Ngugi, in a statement. “We commit to ensuring that all our operations are carried out in a manner that protects life, the environment and the community in general.” Ngugi was speaking at a recent public safety sensitisation workshop for public administration officers in Nairobi. The meeting was also attended by representatives from the Ministry of Interior and Co-ordination of National Government, Ministry of Energy, the Multi-Sectoral Agency Consultative Committee, and the Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority. The campaign comes as research by the company has found the leading causes of electrocution to be poor wiring at customer premises at 24% as illegal connections cause 16% of accidents. Structures and buildings near power lines take up 12% while deliberate acts take up 9%. The study also indicated that the 10 leading counties in cases of electrocution are Nakuru, Nairobi, Kericho, Uasin Gishu and Siaya. Also on the list are Busia, Nyamira, Meru, Kirinyaga and Kiambu. Data shows the company’s customer base as at the end of June 2020 stood at over 7.5 million. --TheStandard--
