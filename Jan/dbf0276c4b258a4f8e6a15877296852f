It is not exactly clear what happened but the left wing by the engine caught fire when the aircraft was landing. Fire-fighters have managed to control the fire and everyone was safely evacuated and air traffic is back to normal at the airport. The plane did not belong to the UN mission but was supporting South African peacekeepers deployed to the country. --BBC--
