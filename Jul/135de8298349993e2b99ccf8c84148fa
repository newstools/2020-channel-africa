The 28-year-old has previously played his trade in Europe with FK Rostov. He had joined the Russian Premier League side from Mamelodi Sundowns. A return to South Africa followed, and after time spent with Kaizer Chiefs, Xulu joined the Team of Choice, where he has spent the past three seasons. Xulu's agency Siyavuma Sports Group told Soccer Laduma: "We are really happy for Siyanda, he deserves an opportunity like this, not an easy thing to secure an overseas move in this climate for any player. "A lot of hard work has gone in from our side, but as always we know Siyanda will go there and give it his all. "He's a great professional, fantastic player and a gentleman to go with it and someone we all value within the team at SSG." --news24--
