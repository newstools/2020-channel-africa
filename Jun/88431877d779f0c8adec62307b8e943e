Kushayb surrendered himself to authorities in the Central African Republic where he had been hiding since February when Sudan announced it would hand over suspects wanted by the ICC. A warrant of arrest was issued against him in April 2007 listing 50 counts which include war crimes and crimes against humanity. During the initial appearance hearing, the judge will verify the identity of the suspect and the language in which he is able to follow the proceedings. He will be informed of the charges against him. Kushayb will be represented by Cyril Laucci. Four other warrants of arrest are still pending against ousted Sudanese President, Omar Al Bashir, Abdel Raheem Hussein, Ahmad Harun and Abdallah Banda. They are all implicated in genocide and war crimes committed in the Darfur conflict, which broke out in 2003 and has claimed over 300 000 lives. --BBCâ€”
