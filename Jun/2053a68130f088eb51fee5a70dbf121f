Roux confirmed revenues had increased by 2.5% to R1.29 billion ($75.8 million) at the body’s Annual General Meeting, but that was offset, in part, by a reduction in test guaranteed income due to fewer Springbok matches. He also confirmed that Bok players and management staff had been paid R62 million ($3.6 million) in performance bonuses for winning the Rugby World Cup in Japan. “The measures that we have implemented in recent years allowed us to deliver a very satisfactory result at the end of 2019,” Roux said. “We improved our overall solvency and financial position through fully impairing all loans, investments or receivables where the recovery of such was in doubt.” He reiterated that the cuts to spending recently introduced by SA Rugby to the tune of R1.2 billion ($94 million) for 2020 were necessary to offset the effects of COVID-19 on operations. “The pandemic has had the effect of tearing up all our approved budgetary plans but we have taken an aggressive approach to the potential impact of the virus,” he said. “It will be painful to endure for all rugby businesses, but it will mean that we will walk from the burning building still intact.” ($1 = R17.04) --Reuters--
