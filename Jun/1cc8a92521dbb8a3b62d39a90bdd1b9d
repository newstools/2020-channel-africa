“The pandemic has forced us to divert and realign our budget so that we can address this coronavirus challenge,” said King Mswati III, Africa’s last absolute monarch, in a statement released on Friday. The fiscal deficit is set to widen to 9.1% from 4.3%. The landlocked southern African nation formerly known as Swaziland was among the last in the world to record a COVID-19 death in late April. It has now documented 279 positive cases with 2 deaths. Most of eSwatini’s 1.5 million people eke out a living as farmers or migrant labourers in neighbouring South Africa. --Reuters--
