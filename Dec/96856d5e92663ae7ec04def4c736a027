Fund Spokesperson, Gerry Rice, told a regular news briefing that an Extended Fund Facility discussed by IMF staff with Kenyan authorities would provide resources for the next phase of the East African country's COVID-19 response while advancing structural reforms. The size and phasing of the agreement had not yet been determined, Rice said. "Discussions on remaining areas will continue in the coming period with a view to reaching agreement on a program that could be presented to our board, we think in early 2021," Rice said. --Reuters--
