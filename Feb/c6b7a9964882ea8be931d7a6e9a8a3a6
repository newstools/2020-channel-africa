That is the view of Max Verstappen, who along with Red Bull-Honda has clearly targeted stopping Hamilton from winning a seventh title in 2020.

"Lewis is getting older, he's 35 now I think. He won't keep going forever, at some point he will stop. But ultimately it depends mainly on the team, not Lewis," Verstappen, 22, told Auto Zeitung.

Verstappen says he respects Hamilton, but he recently said the Briton is "not God". Now, he adds: "Hamilton, Vettel and Leclerc are all great drivers. But they're all very different. Lewis is very, very good. I respect him as a very strong racer. Â But as a driver you depend a lot on your car. "If Fernando Alonso had been in that Mercedes, he would have won. It is also about being with a team that can develop that sort of dominance." Verstappen also weighed into the debate about the size of the F1 calendar, saying plans to expand the 22-race schedule to up to 25 should be scrapped. "25 is clearly too many," he said.
