The cases brought to three the number of people infected with the virus in the North African country. The two people were put in isolation in Blida province south of the capital, Algiers, the ministry said in a statement. The woman and her daughter in February hosted an 83-year-old man and his daughter based in France who were tested positive for coronavirus after their return to France, the statement said. Algeria last week announced its first coronavirus case, an Italian national who arrived in the country on February17. He was later flown home to Italy, which has almost 1 700 cases.
