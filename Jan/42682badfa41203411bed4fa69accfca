While Eskom is overseen by Public Enterprises, Pravin Gordhan, has borne the brunt of the blame for the outages, criticism is increasingly being directed at another target: Mineral Resources and Energy Minister, Gwede Mantashe, who is also chairperson of the ruling party. The 64-year-old former miner and labour union leader is one of President Cyril Ramaphosa’s most important political allies, yet his reticence to fast-track renewable power projects could prolong the electricity shortages, which have caused the economy to stagnate and sapped investor confidence. Increased use of solar and wind energy would reduce South Africa’s reliance on coal, which is currently used to generate the bulk of electricity utilized in the continent’s most industrialized economy. That prospect bodes ill for about 87 000 coal miners, many of them members of the National Union of Mineworkers, which Mantashe led from 1998 to 2006. “He is a calculating man. The reason he is where he is because he comes with the unions,” said Ralph Mathekga, an analyst and author of books on South African politics. “He manages to restrain Ramaphosa in the interest of his old traditional allies.” --News24--
