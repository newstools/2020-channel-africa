The Chairperson of the panel, Doris Okuwobi, has said that they have been “inundated with so many cases and the panel must move faster”. The panel has also been asked to investigate what happened last week at the Lekki Toll Gate where Amnesty International say protesters were shot at by the Nigerian Army and the Nigerian Police force. The panel was set up to hear cases of police brutality by the disbanded Sars unit. Its formation was after weeks of deadly protests calling for major reforms. --BBC--
