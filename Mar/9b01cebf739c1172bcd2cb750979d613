In a statement on Saturday, the electricity supplier said the electricity which the company is getting from diesel generators and Electricity Generation Company (EGENCO) is not adequate to satisfy demand. “We have been compelled to affect a seven-hour Electricity Management Programme for the period from March 21 to March 24, 2020,” reads part of the statement. Under the programme, ESCOM customers have been grouped into three with each group experiencing a 7-hour power outage each day. The seven-hour load shedding programme replaces the four-and-hour load shedding which ESCOM has been implementing since February after EGENCO started working on its machines at Kapichira Power Station and its diesel generators at Kanengo. --Malawi24--
