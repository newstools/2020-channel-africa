More than 2 300 people have been killed since the outbreak began in DRC in 2018. WHO's Regional Director for Africa, Dr Matshidiso Moeti, tweeted that there were currently no cases of Ebola in the country, and she was "cautiously optimistic" that the outbreak would be brought to an end soon. WHO Head, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said no new infections had been reported in the last two weeks. "This is very encouraging, but the outbreak is not over and we are still in full response mode," he added. DRC would have to go for 42 days without reporting a case for the outbreak to be declared over. --BBC--
