The Education Minister George Magoha said the government would begin sending funds to public schools starting on Thursday. Face coverings reduce the spread of coronavirus droplets from coughs, sneezes and speaking. They should mainly be worn to protect other people from coronavirus, rather than yourself. When worn correctly, they should cover the nose and mouth, which are the main confirmed sources of transmission. They can help to reduce the spread of the virus from people who are contagious, including those who have no symptoms, or are yet to develop them. --BBC--
