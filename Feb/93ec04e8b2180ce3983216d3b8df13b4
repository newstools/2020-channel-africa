That brings the total of confirmed infections on the ship to174 people out of 492 tests so far, the Health Ministry said in a statement. The Diamond Princess was placed in quarantine for two weeks upon arriving in Yokohama, south of Tokyo, on Feb. 3, after a man who disembarked in Hong Kong was diagnosed with the virus. About 3 700 people are aboard the ship, which usually has a crew of 1 100 and a passenger capacity of 2 670. The ministry said tests are being conducted for others who are deemed to need them and it will announce the results later. The United Kingdom-flagged Diamond Princess is managed by Princess Cruise Lines, one of the worldâ€™s largest cruise lines and a unit of Carnival Corp.
