Two deadlines have already been missed. Discussions will focus on security arrangements and the sharing of power in a new administration. Former rebel leader, Riek Machar, arrived in South Sudan on Monday ahead of the latest talks with President, Salva Kiir. Machar has been living in the Sudanese capital, Khartoum, and agreements on security will play a key role in whether a new transitional government is announced and he formally returns to the country. All warring parties were meant to have jointly trained and unified their forces but this has not happened. In 2016, the first peace agreement fell apart when Kiir and Machar’s forces clashed in the capital. Now, there’s increased pressure from the United States and nearby countries that a new administration be formed, leaving the main parties with little room for manoeuvre. --BBC--
