Officials said they were guarding against the importation of the coronavirus from Djibouti, which has seen more than 1035 cases so far, the most in the Horn of Africa. Officials also said the returnees were using illegal routes. In recent days, hundreds of Ethiopians resident in Djibouti have illegally crossed into Ethiopia, raising concern among health authorities. Late last month, Ethiopia closed its land borders with six neighbouring countries affecting movement and cross-border commerce. The illegal entry of migrants from Djibouti is now posing a health risk for Ethiopia, and complicates the countryâ€™s efforts to contain spread of the virus. State-affiliated media Fana Broadcasting Corporate cited Lemlem Bezabih, head of Dire Dawa city Health Office, as saying the office is working with community members to tackle the challenge. According to Lemlem, some of the illegal returnees have tested positive for Covid-19 and her office is tracing individuals who had contact with them. Despite limitations in terms of controlling illegal entry to Ethiopia from Djibouti, regional health workers have intensified containment efforts and surveillance against individuals who had contacts with Covid-19 positive people. Last week, Ethiopia said it had quarantined over 300 illegal migrants and are tracing others to prevent potential community spread. --TheEastAfrican--
