But the progress left an internal EU dispute over Belarus unresolved - Cyprus, which - backed by Greece - is at odds with Turkey over maritime energy resources, is blocking EU sanctions on Minsk until the bloc takes a tougher stance towards Ankara. The fate of proposed sanctions on some 40 senior Belarusian officials is up in the air, eroding EU credibility as it seeks to support a pro-democracy movement in Belarus after its August 9 election that the West says was rigged. EU sanctions require the support of all 27 member states. “I’m afraid that, as things stand right now, we will have to insist on Belarus. It’s the only weapon that we have,” a Cypriot diplomat told Reuters, saying that the EU had not left Cyprus with a diplomatic way out of the impasse. Mediation led by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and European Council President Charles Michel has calmed Greek and Turkish tempers after weeks of tension in the eastern Mediterranean, securing an agreement on Tuesday to restart talks on continental shelf boundaries that broke off in 2016. “Dialogue has reduced the need to threaten sanctions on Turkey and so there’s no consensus among the 27 for such a step right now,” said one EU diplomat. Turkey’s decision to pull a seismic exploration ship out of disputed waters was seen as helpful. A postponement of Thursday’s EU summit in Brussels, due to focus on Turkey, has also served to allow more time, a second diplomat said. The summit, which was put off due to a coronavirus incident in Michel’s security detail, will now take place on October 1-2.
