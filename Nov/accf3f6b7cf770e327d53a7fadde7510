United States (US) crude oil rose more than 8% and pushed up energy stocks while safe-haven US Treasuries sold off after US drugmaker Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech said a large-scale trial of their vaccine showed it was more than 90% effective in preventing Covid-19. Investors said they were also reassured by Saturday’s news that Joe Biden had garnered enough votes to win the US presidential election as they had priced in this news last week. “Election uncertainty is fading into the rear-view mirror. Now we have this boost of investor enthusiasm after the vaccine news,” said to Michael Antonelli, market strategist at Baird in Milwaukee. “All the types of companies that would benefit from us returning to a pre-Covid-19 world are the big winners today.” Sectors such as energy, travel and financials which were among the hardest hit by lockdowns aimed at curbing the virus were some of the biggest percentage gainers on Monday. While their vaccine study is still ongoing and requires approval, Pfizer and BioNTech said they had found no serious safety concerns so far and expected to seek US emergency use authorization later this month. “It’s not that we’re out of the woods with Covid-19. It’s that the vaccine starts to remove the worst case scenario that we surge out of control and go back into a national lockdown,” said Antonelli. “The market’s looking into the future, to the first and second quarter of next year.” However the S&P pared some gains late in the session. US Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Monday said President Donald Trump was completely within his rights to look into “irregularities” from last week’s election. Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Investment Management in Chicago, pinned the late session fading on “profit-taking” after the morning rally. --Reuters--
