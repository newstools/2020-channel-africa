The TaxOn App will help clients to use their phones to pay and access various types of taxes and related services like taxpayer registration, filing of returns, verification, and clearance of vehicles among others. It has been developed with the support of a local consultancy firm, GIZ Zambia. Zambia Revenue Authority (ZRA) Commissioner Indirect Taxes, Moses Shuko, said during the launch that the system will also help widen tax payment as it will be able to capture the informal sector as well. According to him, the tax agency has identified strategic initiatives aimed at enhancing customer experience and promoting a culture of tax compliance. GIZ Component Co-ordinator, Johannes Kurt, said increasing digital access and offering more e-services was a notable success especially in the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic. "This application also provides a significant contribution to achieving the objectives of ZRA corporate strategic plan notably for more satisfied and knowledgeable taxpayers," he said. --Xinhua--
