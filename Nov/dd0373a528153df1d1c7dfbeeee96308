President Nana Akufo-Addo, in a televised address on Sunday, said the government would step up contact tracing, testing and treatment of Covid-19 cases to stop the spread. The government has also extended pay incentives for health workers to the end of December 2020, which include tax exemption and a 50% pay raise for Covid-19 front-line workers. Ghanaians will also continue to enjoy free water supply to promote regular hand-washing. Akufo-Addo attributed the increased infections to disregard of Covid-19 safety protocols, including social distancing and the wearing of masks. Although large political rallies are banned in the country, campaign activities have heightened ahead of polls in December 2020, with many ignoring the safety protocols. Ghanaâ€™s active cases have increased to 1 139 from 398 over the last three weeks. The country has so far registered 320 deaths as of Friday. --BBC--
