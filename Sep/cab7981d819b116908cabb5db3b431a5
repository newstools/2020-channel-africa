UN investigators have said that while there had been hope for change when President Evariste Ndayishimiye replaced Pierre Nkurunziza in June so far those hopes had not been realised. They have just completed their latest report covering May 2019 to May 2020; the UNâ€™s fourth into Burundi, which suggests that serious violations had continued unabated. But the investigators also looked into the current situation. Discussing their findings, Francoise Hampson, said that though there was an expectation that the new president would usher in a new era, "there have continued to be killings, arbitrary detention and disappearances, and that is a matter of very grave concern". --BBC--
