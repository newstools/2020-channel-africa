Johnson shot his best round of the tournament on Sunday with a third-round 64 to sit five shots clear of the field as he guns for $15 million in prize money and the missing piece to his resume. The 36-year-old would have been crowned FedExCup champion four years ago if Rory McIlroy had not pipped Kevin Chappell and Ryan Moore in the three-man playoff at the Tour Championship. Johnson said that disappointment would serve as motivation. “Yeah to be the FedExCup champion is something I want to do. It’s something that I want on my resume when I quit playing golf. “It means a lot to me. I do want to win this tournament,” Johnson told reporters. “I had a chance to win it a few years ago. Not really in control of that one, so it’s a little bit different. I didn’t play well, I couldn’t control winning by my golf. I was pulling hard for Kevin Chappell. “Tomorrow I do. I control my destiny. I need to go out and play like I did today. I’m swinging good. I’ve got a lot of confidence in the game.” Fellow American Xander Schauffele, who was second after a round of 67, said that it would be “almost impossible” to catch an in-form Johnson on the final day. “I can try and influence him, which he probably won’t really care about,” Schauffele added. “If I birdie the first three holes it’s not going to faze him. It’s DJ. We’ve seen him do it for 20 plus years now, and I just have to try and be better.” --Reuters--
