The central Chinese city was the original epicentre of the pandemic and nearly 4 000 people died from the disease there before it spread worldwide. But the annual Wuhan Open is now pencilled in for October 19-25 after the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) this week released its provisional calendar for the rest of the year. The schedule "is conditioned on several key factors" including player safety, government approvals and relaxation of travel restrictions, the WTA said.Â 

At present, most foreign nationals are barred from entering China. Wuhan Open co-director Brenda Perry told AFP the tournament will not go ahead if overseas players cannot come, and that a final decision will be made around early August. But she added: "I'm thrilled for all my colleagues and friends in Wuhan, and what this will mean to the city and the people of the city. "It's hugely symbolic of overcoming a hugely challenging moment. They went through what seemed to me one of the most stringent lockdowns in the world," said the 62-year-old, speaking by telephone from Auckland. "To come through that and then hold an international professional tennis event would be amazing for morale and show the world the great job they've done on recovery." In 2019 Wuhan Open had a nearly $3 million prize fund and a high-quality field, with world number one Ashleigh Barty losing in the semi-finals to eventual champion Aryna Sabalenka of Belarus. --Reuters--
