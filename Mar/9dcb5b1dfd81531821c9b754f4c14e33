Repatriation flights were planned for tourists now stranded in Morocco, the Dominican Republic, the Philippines and the Maldives, he said, adding that the government expected worldwide air passenger volumes to stay at a very low level for the foreseeable future. “We don’t want to see further tourists stranded abroad,” he said. “For this reason we have decided to issue a warning against all touristic trips abroad. Please stay at home.” --Reuters--
