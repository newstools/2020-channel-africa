The cases in the England camp were announced on Sunday before the tour was abandoned a day later. But England say the duo have been given the all-clear by "independent virologists in Cape Town and London". England will fly home on Thursday. Had the pair not been cleared they would have had to remain in South Africa until December 15. Instead, they are no longer isolating at the team's hotel in Cape Town and are free to rejoin the rest of the touring party before their departure.

The news of the negative tests provides relief for England at the end of a difficult tour. All three Twenty20 matches were played as planned, with England winning the series 3-0, but Friday's first one-day international was postponed when it emerged an unnamed South Africa player had returned a positive test. Sunday's game was called off after two hotel staff tested positive and later that day, England announced two members of their touring party had given positive tests. England's medical team saw anomalies in the test results prior to the independent ratification process.
