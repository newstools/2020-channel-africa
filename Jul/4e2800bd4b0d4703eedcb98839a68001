President Cyril Ramaphosa said it was important to ensure that schools did not become sites of transmission at a time when coronavirus cases in South Africa are rising at one of the fastest rates in the world. Older students in primary and secondary schools returned to schools on July 6. "Taking into account the views of the various stakeholders and expert bodies, cabinet has decided that all public schools should take a break for the next four weeks," President Ramaphosa said. He said the current academic year will be extended beyond the end of 2020 as a result of the disruptions caused by the pandemic. "We have taken a deliberately cautious approach to keep schools closed during a period when the country is expected to experience its greatest increase in infections," he said. The president also announced a $30bn package to fund health services and help those in greatest need. --BBC--
