Apart from the expansion of Hwange Power Station, some of the joint projects between China and Zimbabwe include the construction of the New Parliament building in Mount Hampden and the expansion of the Robert Mugabe International Airport. Although the global Covid-19 pandemic has stalled some of the projects, Guo on Wednesday said there was now appetite to proceed with the projects with the supervision of the Zimbabwean Government. “We encourage the Chinese businesses in Zimbabwe to resume work under the guidance of your government,” he said. With Zimbabwe witnessing a disturbing surge in Covid-19 infections, Guo said necessary steps were being taken to ensure that the safety of those involved in the flagship projects was guaranteed. “We are taking all necessary steps to ensure good progress at our joint flagship projects, including the expansion of Hwange Power Station and the Robert Mugabe International Airport. We are keeping our co-operation in agriculture, and many other areas robust,” he added. Apart from pursuing already existing projects, Guo said the embassy is still wooing investors from China to invest in Zimbabwe. --Herald--
