This came as health sector workers staged a demonstration at one of the biggest referral hospitals in Harare, demanding remuneration in foreign currency to cope with the ever-rising cost of living with the Zimbabwean dollar. The government last week dispelled reports that some in the security services were plotting to overthrow Mnangagwa, who replaced former leader Robert Mugabe after a November 2017 coup. Since taking over, Mnangagwa has presided over a marked decline in economic productivity. Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube, who has faced mounting pressure to float the fixed exchange rate, said on Wednesday: "Zimbabwe civil servants salaries adjusted by 50% with immediate effect. In addition, a non-taxable Covid-19 allowance of $75 per month (will be implemented) for civil servants whilst pensioners will get $30 per month.‚Äù The US dollar allowances will be paid for three months, while the civil servants have now been asked to open Foreign Currency Accounts with local finance institutions. Treasury said in a separate statement that the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe is "urgently addressing the domestic payments infrastructure in light of the increased need for translatability". --News24--
