The company will lay out its arguments against a $2.6 billion fine handed out by the European Commission during a three-day hearing at the General Court. European Union (EU) regulators said this penalty was for Google’s favouring its own price comparison shopping service to the disadvantage of smaller European rivals. The EU has fined Google a total of $9 billion in three separate cases, including one involving its Android smartphone operating system. This is four times more than its rival Microsoft’s EU fines of $3 billion. Both companies’ regulatory troubles in Europe have lasted a decade. Google is expected to launch a three-pronged attack against the Commission’s 2017 decision which also included an order to treat competitors equally.
