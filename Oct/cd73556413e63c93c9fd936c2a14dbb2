A draft addition to the deal says electric and hybrid cars will only get zero tariffs if a majority of the parts' value is from the two areas. The draft, seen by the BBC, means that even if there is a deal, some UK car exports to the EU will not be eligible. And this means tariffs of 10% will apply from January. The draft, was circulated among EU member states on Tuesday, says that Annex II of the agreement on "Product Specific Rules of Origin" will specify the "maximum content of non-originating [that is non EU and United Kingdom (UK) materials of 45% of the ex-works price of the vehicle" for "electrified vehicles" from January 1 2021. Last month, the UK circulated a proposal, also seen by the BBC, that in the case of electric and hybrid cars, only a minority of parts would at first need to be either from the UK or the EU - and up to 70% could come from elsewhere. This had been requested by key car export factories, dependent on electric batteries, hybrid systems, and other technology, mainly from Japan. Â
