The US Company saw digital sales rocket 82% during the June to August quarter, offsetting falling revenue in its stores. On Tuesday, Nike posted revenue of $10.6 billion as many of its key markets recovered including China. For its previous quarter revenues were down by more than a third as it tackled store closures and lockdowns globally. Nike Chief Executive Officer John Donahoe said the shift to online sales could be a permanent trend. "We know that digital is the new normal. The consumer today is digitally grounded and simply will not revert back," Donahoe said. Sales are growing in its major markets including China, Japan, South Korea and the UK, while its core North American market is declining. Nike's shares rose more than 10% in late trading in the US, as the results were better than Wall Street had expected. --BBC--
