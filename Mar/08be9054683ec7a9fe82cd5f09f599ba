President Uhuru Kenyatta has also ordered a curfew, pay cuts and tax reliefs in a range of measures to combat coronavirus. In a televised address, President Kenyatta described the full recovery of the patient as encouraging news. However, Kenya’s confirmed cases also rose by three to 28 on the same day. To curb the spread, he ordered a daily curfew from 7pm to 5am local time (1600GMT to 0200GMT) beginning Friday. Kenyatta also announced a 100% tax relief for persons earning up to $240 a month, while the others will pay 5% less on income tax. There were also reductions on corporate and value added tax. The financial changes begin on April 1, and are subject to parliamentary approval. Additionally, Kenyatta announced voluntary pay cuts for himself and senior civil servants to free up funds to fight coronavirus. The President and his deputy shall take an 80% pay cut, while Cabinet Ministers will volunteer 30% of their salaries. He called on all arms of the government to join in by making similar voluntary reductions. He also announced a $100 million cash transfer to cushion the country’s vulnerable population, including the elderly and the orphans. All government personnel aged 50 years and above will proceed on leave or work from home. The order excludes personnel in the security sector and other essential services.
