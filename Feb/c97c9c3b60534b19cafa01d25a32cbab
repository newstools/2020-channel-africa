The security memo, which was sent to all students on Tuesday, was "insensitive", the University of Nairobi's vice chancellor admitted. A petition started in response to the memo questioned how women could be blamed for their own rape. Popular media personality, Adelle Onyango, posted on Instagram: "This is what victim shaming looks like." The 31-year-old, who is a rape survivor, told her 374 000 followers that she was outraged that the University had had no condemnation for the rapists. "This is what normalisation of rape looks like. And we will not stand for it." The memo, signed by the head of security, said the rising number of cases of robbery and rape of University students in the capital, Nairobi, occurred at certain spots close to campuses. "In all the three rape incidences reported in 2019, a clear case of recklessness on the part of our female students can be drawn," it said. It gave an example of a drunk student who was gang raped on her way back in the early hours of the morning. It also included tips about how to keep safe in social gatherings, suggesting students always go out with trusted friends, memorise important numbers in case they lost a phone and never leave their drinks unattended.
