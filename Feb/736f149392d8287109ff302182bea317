Mene, who served as the country's chief negotiator at AfCFTA, bested Nigeria's preferred candidate, Cecelia Akintomide, and will be stationed in Accra, Ghana. International Relations and Cooperation Minister Naledi Pandor welcomed Mene's appointment. The AfCFTA forms part of broader efforts to remove tariffs on up to 90% of exports to foster more trade among countries on the continent as Western countries usually trade more with African nations individually than the latter do with each other.    

In October 2019, Business Day reported on Mene's criticism of attacks on foreign nationals in South Africa, saying the violence would put South Africa on the backfoot of negotiations around the AfCFTA which the South African economy stood to benefit from. Mene holds a BA in law from Rhodes University, an LLM in banking law and financial regulation from the London School of Economics and Political Science as well as a Master's of arts in international studies and diplomacy from the School of Oriental and African Studies at the University of London.
