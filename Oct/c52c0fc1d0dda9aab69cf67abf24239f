Somalia-based Islamist militants al-Shabab said they carried out the attack. The state said the attackers involved were dead. More than 140 witnesses testified in the case, in which the accused persons denied conspiring to commit terrorism. A conviction will encourage a country that remains on high alert over possible terrorist attacks, and whose military is still in Somalia fighting al-Shabab from their bases. --BBC--
