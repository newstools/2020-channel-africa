The Ugandan-made products, under the Lato brand, were seized on separate dates this month. Uganda's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has written to the Kenyan High Commission demanding the immediate release of the consignment. It accused its neighbour of contravening a treaty of the regional bloc East African Community allowing for the free movement of goods. Uganda said it was exercising "maximum restraint" on Kenya's imports, but "reserves the right to reconsider this position". The protest comes a day after Kenya's President, Uhuru Kenyatta announced a 16% value added tax on all imported milk products that originate outside the East Africa community. His family is the majority owner of Brookside Dairies, the country's largest milk processor. Kenyatta said the measure was intended to protect local farmers who are facing a glut and low prices. --BBC--
