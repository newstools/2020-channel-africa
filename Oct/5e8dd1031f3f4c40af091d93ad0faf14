The deaths had sparked rumours of an assassination campaign, AFP news agency reported. LINA quoted Weah as urging people not to speculate, and to await the outcome of investigations. Weah had instructed Justice Minister Frank Musa Dean to coordinate his efforts with partners of the government, including the US, LINA reported. It named one of the officials who had died as the head of the Internal Audit Agency, Emmanuel Nyeswua. The other two worked for the Liberia Revenue Authority, but LINA did not name them. AFP news agency reported that four - not three - officials had died in just over a week. AFP quoted Weah as saying that the US embassy in Monrovia had been asked to help, including in finding a pathologist to examine the corpses to determine what caused the deaths. --BBC--
