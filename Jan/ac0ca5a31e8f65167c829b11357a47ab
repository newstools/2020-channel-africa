The five interlocking rings will be installed at Odaiba Marine Park in Tokyo Bay, the site for the marathon swimming and triathlon events at this yearâ€™s Games. The monument, built in Yokohama and brought to the Tokyo waterfront area atop a salvage barge, is 32.6 metres wide and stands 15.3 metres tall. It will be officially inaugurated at a ceremony on January 24, exactly six months before the start of the Olympics. During the August 25 to September 6 Paralympic Games, the monument will be replaced with the Paralympic symbol. --Reuters--
