The Zimbabwe National Water Authority (Zinwa) and local authorities have already started water rationing, but there is need to scale up the measures. Three months from now, local authorities will renew their annual abstraction agreements with Zinwa where water allocations will be done in consideration of dam levels and river flows. Water abstraction agreements allow Zinwa to properly and efficiently allocate available water resources among competing users. Any use of water from Zinwa managed dams without the requisite agreement constitutes a criminal offence and offenders are liable to prosecution. According to statistics, Beitbridge which draws water from Beitbridge 1 and 2 dams, is in critical condition as it is left with 1.6 months’ supply. Plumtree is left with enough water for 5.1 months, Karoi 6.2 months, Figtree 3.4 months, Gwanda 8.9 months and Mutoko 9.9 months. Gweru, which draws water from Gwenoro, Amapongokwe and White Waters is left with 8.9 months’ supply. The city last year released a water rationing schedule that resulted in residents going for up to 24 hours without supplies. Mutare, which draws water from Odzani Dams and Pungwe River stands at 13.7 months’ supply and is at Zinwa’s “monitor and demand phase”. Harare and its satellite towns as well as Chinhoyi that draws water from Manyame Dam have enough water for 21.5 months, meaning they can survive another drought. In an interview yesterday, Zinwa acting corporate communications and marketing manager,  Tsungirirai Shoriwa, said water levels in most dams around the country continue receding. Shoriwa said the declining water levels were due to high temperatures, low to no inflows and water draw-downs for irrigation and domestic use which are greater than the rate of inflows. He said water remains a finite resource which needs to be used sparingly. --Herald--
