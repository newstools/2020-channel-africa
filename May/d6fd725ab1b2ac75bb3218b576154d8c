Sirleaf is said to have discovered the disappearance moments after corruption charges were dropped against him last week. 

He had been arrested in 2019 when he was serving as Deputy Governor of Liberia's Central Bank, accused of involvement in the illegal printing and importation of huge sums of local currency. Last week the government dropped embezzlement charges against him and four others, saying they had been acting under the instructions of Milton Weeks, the former central bank governor. 

He remains on trial and denies the charges. Police spokesperson Moses Carter told the BBC that officers had gathered statements from tellers of the bank to investigate Sirleaf's complaint. Sirleaf’s lawyer, Johnny Momo, confirmed there was an ongoing investigation by police. --BBC--
