Ralepelle was banned for eight years last month after he was found guilty by an independent doping tribunal, almost 18 months after he tested positive for a banned anabolic steroid, Zeranol. The 33-year-old, who was playing for the Sharks at the time, claimed, in appeal documents seen by Sport24, he did not even know the substance existed before his January 17,2019 test came back positive. However, Ralepelle faces an uphill battle trying to prove "ignorance" with regards to the partial sample and Zeranol as well as flouted doping control collections rules and alleged false DCO testimony are enough to show they had a material effect on the eventual adverse finding. The South African Institute for Drug-free Sport's (Saids) policy, which is in line with the World Doping Agency's, places "the burden of proof upon the athlete that he or she did not act intentionally â€¦ and that the athlete has to either rebut a presumption or establish specified facts or circumstances 'by a balance of probability' - which means that the circumstances established by the athlete have to be 'more likely than not'". Last month, Ralepelle told Sport24: "The DCO lied in front of the tribunal and there were a lot of discrepancies along the line. Because I signed the documentation after the test, they are going back to that paper." Ralepelle, who has tested positive for a prohibited substance twice before, said in the appeal notice filed to Saids he never considered taking a banned substance because he was being tested regularly (as a result of the two previous findings), an assertion the panel dismissed outright. It is extremely rare that athletes who have tested positive and found guilty have successfully had their convictions overturned. If Ralepelle fails in his appeal, it would mark the end of the former Springbok's once-promising career. --news24--
