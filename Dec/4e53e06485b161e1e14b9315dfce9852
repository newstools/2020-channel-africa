The world champion missed the Sakhir Grand Prix in Bahrain last weekend after contracting coronavirus. Hamilton remains in isolation and must return a negative test result before he is allowed to travel to Abu Dhabi. "His condition's improving but we won't know closer to the time if he will be driving," said team boss Toto Wolff. "We'll do everything we can to get him in the car and we know he's determined to be back as soon as possible. But his health is our main priority, so we will see what the situation is and then make the call." George Russell is in line to replace Hamilton if he cannot race. The 22-year-old Williams driver starred on his Mercedes debut in Bahrain and was prevented from winning only by a pit-stop mix-up and then a puncture.
