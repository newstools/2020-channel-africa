The Clever Boys' first-choice goalkeepers, Ricardo Goss and Brandon Peterson, are both out of contention ahead of the clash with Mamelodi Sundowns at Orlando Stadium on Saturday. Brighton Mhlongo will start the game for Wits in the duo's absence, and goalkeeping Coach, Tyron Damons, has also been included in the team as backup. "Goss is out because he's still got the five-game suspension. Brandon is out as well‚" Hunt told the media. "Brighton has to play. We have also brought our Multichoice Diski Challenge (reserve team) goalkeeper up‚ who I haven't seen much of." Asked whether Damons has been registered, Hunt added: "Yes, he is registered and may have to do a job for us." Kick-off is at 19:15. --News24--
