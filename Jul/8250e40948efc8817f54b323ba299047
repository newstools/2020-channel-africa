Ouattara announced in March 2020 that he would not run in an election in October after 10 years in office, and designated Gon Coulibaly, his closest political ally, as the Rally of Houphouëtists for Democracy and Peace (RHDP) party’s candidate. Gon Coulibaly’s death on Wednesday, less than a week after he returned to Ivory Coast from an extended medical leave in France for heart issues, left the RHDP scrambling to choose a replacement candidate. RHDP Executive Secretary Adama Bictogo told journalists the party could ask Ouattara to reverse his decision not to stand. “It’s clear we have to revisit the analysis he made at the time,” Bictogo said. “The context is new,” he said, adding that all options were on the table. Earlier two sources said RHDP’s leaders had agreed at a closed-door meeting late on Wednesday to press Ouattara to run again. Ouattara has previously said he would prefer to hand over power to a new generation, although he also says he has the right to run again under a new constitution adopted in 2016. --Reuters--
