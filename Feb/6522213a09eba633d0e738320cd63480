Harvests have been smaller and poorer in quality because of prolonged heavy rains that led to flash floods, landslides, and the destruction of agricultural land. In Kenya, one tomato used cost about $0.05 but some shops have increased their prices seven-fold. Last year, swathes of East Africa experienced one of the wettest rainy seasons on record - with total rainfall four times higher than average, according to the Kenya Meteorological Department. With above average rainfall predicted across Kenya in the next few months, it is expected that prices of ready-made food will go up.
