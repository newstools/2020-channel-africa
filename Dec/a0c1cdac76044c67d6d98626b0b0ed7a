Estimates from the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) show that as at October 30, 2020, Zimbabwe had registered a 48% jump in remittances to $760 million, from the prior comparable period. This was largely due to increased use of formal channels, amid national lockdowns and restrictionsÂ implemented by countries due to Covid-19. Central bank Governor Dr John Mangudya last month said remittances were bringing in about $90 million a month. With $760 million in remittances having come into the country in the first 10 months of the year, a projected $180 million between November and December could take that figure to around $940 million. But the remittance figures could be higher for December as is normally the trend during the festive season. This is notwithstanding an earlier World Bank forecast that in the wake of the Covid-19 economic crisis, remittance flows to Sub Saharan Africa would fall by 23,1%. For Zimbabwe, Diaspora remittances are a critical source of foreign currency, along with exports of key products like gold, platinum group metals and tobacco. Last year, Diaspora remittances into the country grew by 2.6% to $635 million from $619 million recorded in 2018. --Herald--
