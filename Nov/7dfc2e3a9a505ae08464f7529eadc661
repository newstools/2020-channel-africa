Nadal becomes just the fourth man to achieve 1 000 singles victories in the Open Era, behind Jimmy Connors (1 274), Roger Federer (1 242) and Ivan Lendl (1 068). “One negative thing about 1 000 wins is you are very old because to win 1 000 matches you need to have a very long career, but I am super happy,” Nadal said in courtside. “It means I’ve done a lot of things right. “I’m proud of a lot of things, but I faced some challenges in my career in terms of injuries ... It’s a big achievement to be playing at the age of 34.” Nadal, who was handed a bye in the first round, got off to a terrible start, losing his opening service game and never really coming to terms with Lopez’s blistering serve. Lopez, 39, won a scarcely believable 93% of his first serve points and also sent down eight aces as he wrapped up the opening set in style. “It was a very tough match, and I started the worst way possible with the break against him because you are under a lot of pressure for the whole match,” Nadal added. With both players evenly matched, the second set stayed on serve before Nadal edged a tiebreak to send the contest to a decider. Nadal broke Lopez in his first service game of the third set and then showed his usual levels of laser-like focus to close out the match. Next up for the 20-times Grand Slam champion is a meeting with Australia’s Jordan Thompson in the last 16. Elsewhere, fourth seed Alexander Zverev beat Serbia’s Miomir Kecmanovic 6-2 6-2 to set up a meeting with France’s Adrian Mannarino for a place in the quarter-finals. --Reuters--
