The Nigerian nationals stormed the embassy and vandalised vehicles in the compound. They accused embassy officials of not offering help when they are allegedly harassed by Indonesian immigration officials. They said a Nigerian national reportedly fell from a storey building while escaping from immigration officials. Foreign Affairs Minister Geoffrey Onyeama said those who destroyed property in the embassyâ€™s premises would be tracked down and punished. "Absolutely deplorable and disgraceful criminal behaviour by Nigerian hooligans," he said. --BBC--
