More than 600 000 jobs have been lost within the sector and the numbers are still going up. The industry has now called on the government to ease the border restrictions to allow more international tourists to be able to enter the country. The Durban Promenade is slowly peeking as the summer season begins, but for some Rickshaw operators and many others in the tourism industry who were grounded for the most part of 2020, the future is still bleak. Vukile Gazo moved to Durban in 2010 seeking greener pastures. He survives through the Rickshaw business. Alongside informal traders, he has been hit hard by the pandemic. Gazo’s business strictly relies on tourists. “When the president announced that he was closing the country, we had to go home and it’s been tough. I only came back last week when I heard that the tourism sector is reopening. It’s been tough,” he says. With relaxed Lockdown regulations under Level 1, for the Rickshaw operators, it’s time to try and pick up the pieces. Gazo has asked the municipality for support. “We would like to ask the municipality to support us because this is our only source of income and without their support, it’s like we have no jobs.” Although domestic tourism is open, the sector cannot avoid more job losses. Lindi Mthethwa from Bon Hotels says it is currently impossible to find a job in the tourism industry. --SABC--
