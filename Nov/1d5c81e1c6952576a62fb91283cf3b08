Official forecasts now predict the biggest economic decline in 300 years. The United Kingdom (UK) economy is expected to shrink by 11.3% this year and not return to its pre-crisis size until the end of 2022. Government borrowing will rise to its highest ever level outside of wartime to deal with the economic impact. The government's independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) expects the number of unemployed people in the UK to surge to 2.6 million by mid-2021. This is the highest level since the financial crisis in 2009. However, fewer jobs are expected to be lost than predicted this summer.
