Yarik Turianskyi and Jo-Ansie van Wyk write that Egypt is on the way to join South Africa as a generator of nuclear power, while Ghana, Kenya and Nigeria are still developing nuclear infrastructure, creating the necessary laws and regulations, training personnel and establishing a regulator. Isabel Bosman argues that the time is right for Ghana to pursue its nuclear aspirations alongside other renewable energy generation options to achieve the twin goals of economic development and consistent electricity supply. Sixty years after the first nuclear weapons tests were conducted in Africa, many countries on continent are exploring how nuclear energy could be used for socio-economic development. Seventeen African states have already expressed interest. Some have active nuclear research and development programmes, while others are investigating the possibility of a nuclear build. For the time being, South Africa has the continent's only operational nuclear power plant, but this will change in the near future. Many African countries already possess natural resources required for nuclear energy, and according to Article IV of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, have the right to the peaceful use of nuclear technology. This could specifically be used to achieve developmental objectives in the African Union's long-term vision Agenda 2063 and the Sustainable Development Goals endorsed by the United Nations. --AllAfrica--
