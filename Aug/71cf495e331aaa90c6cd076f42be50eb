Many of last week's stars at the PGA Championship, including winner Collin Morikawa, are taking the week off ahead of next week's start of the playoff events that culminate with September Tour Championship at East Lake in Atlanta. For many players, however, it will take some work to qualify for a berth in the playoffs by finishing in the Top 125 on the FedEx Cup season points list with a strong showing at Sedgefield Country Club. Schwartzel, the 2011 Masters champion, is 125 in points, the player on the bubble to qualify. That can equate to a lip-out putt or a single poor tee shot over the course of the event. Schwartzel was also 125th in 2015, when he shared third to book his playoff berth. The top 96 players in points have their spots secured already, the last of those being American Brandt Snedeker, a two-time winner in Greensboro who has six top-10s in 12 starts, including wins in 2007 and 2018, when he fired a first-round 59 on the way to his most recent PGA victory.
