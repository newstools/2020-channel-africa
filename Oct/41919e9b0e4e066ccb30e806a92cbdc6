Speaking at the 345th session of the Politburo this afternoon, Mnangagwa said gone are the days when members hide behind their status and abuse the name of the party to engage in corruption. “ZANU-PF and this administration will never allow the party to be a haven of malcontents and criminals. 

“I thus exhort party cadres and the citizenry at all levels in line with our national development agenda to be guarantors of a corrupt free Zimbabwe. Report all cases of corruption to the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission and the Zimbabwe Republic Police,” he said. --Herald--
