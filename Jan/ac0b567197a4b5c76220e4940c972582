President Cyril Ramaphosa made the announcement during a media briefing following a meeting with Ethiopia's Prime Minister, Abiy Ahmed, at the Union Buildings in the capital, Pretoria, on Sunday. Ahmed is on a two-day visit which started on Saturday when he attended the ruling African National Congress' January 8 Statement event in the Northern Cape province. During the meeting between the two leaders, Ramaphosa also gave assurances to the Ethiopian Prime Minister that Ethiopians living in South Africa will be protected against any forms of attacks in the country. Responding to a question from an Ethiopian journalist about last year's attacks on foreign nationals, Ramaphosa said the incidents were regrettable.
