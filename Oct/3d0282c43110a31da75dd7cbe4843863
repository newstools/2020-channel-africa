Local media outlets report that the four policemen had fired live ammunition at protesters in the city's Surulere area. Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, named the four policemen who he said were facing a disciplinary trial: Governor Sanwo-Olu also said that the state had established a 200m Nigerian naira ($521,000) fund to compensate victims of police brutality. The federal government has banned protests in the capital Abuja, citing public safety measures to tackle Covid-19. Demonstrations against police brutality have taken place in cities across Nigeria in the past week. The protests have continued despite authorities agreeing to disband the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (Sars). The unit has been accused of extrajudicial killings, extortion and torture, especially of young people. --BBC--
