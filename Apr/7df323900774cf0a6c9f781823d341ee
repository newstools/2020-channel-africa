The lockdown, which started on March 27 and was due to last for 21 days, is one of the toughest measures imposed by an African government. Ramaphosa has sought to explain his reasons for extending the lockdown period, saying should South Africa return to normality too soon, the country risks a massive and uncontrollable resurgence of the coronavirus pandemic. He also added that he will take a salary cut in support of the Solidarity Fund to fight the coronavirus pandemic. The President announced a pay cut of one third for himself, the Deputy President, Ministers and Premiers. The pay cut will apply for the next three months. South Africa has recorded 1934 coronavirus infections and 18 deaths. --Reuters--
