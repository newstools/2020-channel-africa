England's Tom Lewis is the latest to commit to America as he searches for a breakthrough that would, at last, allow him to fulfil massive potential. Despite flashes of genuine quality, the 29-year-old has still to fully realise his spectacular early promise. It helped him lead the 2011 Open at Royal St George's as the first amateur to shoot 65 in the Championship's history. Since then, Lewis - who was named after Tom Watson, with whom he played during that famous round at Sandwich - has won twice on the European Tour without becoming the force that was anticipated. Now he has concluded he must fully commit to the PGA Tour to find out the full extent of his talents. This week Lewis plays the Bermuda Championship with his mind made up that the US circuit should be his main priority. The Welwyn Garden City player's initial opportunity came from winning last year's Korn Ferry Tour Championship, which allowed him to graduate to the full PGA Tour. "Honestly, I always think things happen for a reason," Lewis told BBC Sport. "I got very lucky last year by winning one tournament out of one and that gave me my status."
