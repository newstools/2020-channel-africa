Burundi has experienced a shortage of foreign exchange since 2015 after a political crisis that started when President Pierre Nkurunziza announced in April that year that he would seek a third term in office. He went on to win the election the following July. The European Union (UN) suspended financial support to Burundi in 2016, saying Nkurunziza had not done enough to resolve the political and economic crisis. Burundi’s central bank said in a statement late on Monday it had withdrawn licenses for foreign exchange bureaus for violating rules that allow them to trade currency within an 18% margin of the official exchange rate of 1850 Burundi francs per dollar. “The licenses which were given to the foreign exchange offices are withdrawn,” the central bank said in the statement seen by Reuters on Tuesday, adding the ban would take effect on February15. The bank said commercial banks would however be allowed continue exchanging currencies. Police briefly detained more than 40 money traders in late 2019, accused of violating the foreign exchange trading margins.
