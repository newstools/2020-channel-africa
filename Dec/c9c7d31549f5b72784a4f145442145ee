The dollar nursed losses against major currencies and Treasury yields rose after US President Donald Trump’s approval of a $2.3 trillion stimulus package to counter the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. While the package still has to pass the Senate, Trump’s approval on Sunday sent shares on Wall Street to record highs on Monday amid increased optimism about an economic recovery. “With the Brexit ... and the US stimulus deal now in the rear-view mirror, there is a sense of relief that we have avoided the respective worst-case scenarios,” said Stephen Innes, chief global market strategist at Axi, a broker. Britain clinched a narrow Brexit trade deal with the EU on Thursday, just seven days before it exits one of the world’s biggest trading blocs. Firmer demand for riskier assets kept the U.S. dollar, which is often seen as a “safe-haven” asset, on the back foot. It was down 0.02% against a basket of major currencies. Shorting the dollar has been a popular trade recently and calculations by Reuters based on data released by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission on Monday suggested that trend could endure. Short positions on the dollar swelled in the week ended Dec. 21 to $26.6 billion, the highest in three months. The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies fell to 90.137, not far from the lowest in more than two years.
