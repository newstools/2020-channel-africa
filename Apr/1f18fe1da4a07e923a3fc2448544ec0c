AU Commission Chairperson, Moussa Faki Mahamat, tweeted that he was "surprised by the US campaign against WHO's global leadership". He added that the AU "fully backs WHO and Tedros". Trump tweeted on Tuesday that the WHO was "very China-centric" yet it is "largely" funded by the US. He later suggested in a press conference that the US should "put a hold on money" to the global organisation. One reason Trump cites for his views on the WHO, is its advice in February against imposing travel restrictions against China, when most cases of Covid-19 were concentrated there. --BBC--
