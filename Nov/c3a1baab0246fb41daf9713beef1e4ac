At least 40 bloggers, administrators of widely followed Facebook pages, political activists and human rights defenders have faced criminal prosecution between 2018 and 2020, according to the rights group. They have been charged for "publishing online posts critical of local authorities, the police or other state officials". "These prosecutions threaten the human rights progress made so far in Tunisia where the right to freedom of expression is a hard-won value of the revolution," Amnesty's deputy regional director for the Middle East and North Africa Amna Guellali said in a statement. --BBC--
