Delivering the State-of-the-Nation- Address (SONA) in Parliament, Ramaphosa says in order for Eskom to address its maintenance backlog, load shedding will remain a reality. “The reality that we will need to accept is that in order for Eskom to undertake the fundamental maintenance necessary to improve the reliability of supply, load-shedding will remain a possibility for the immediate future. 

"Where load-shedding is unavoidable, it must be undertaken in a manner that is predictable and minimises disruption and the cost to firms and households.” Eskom has recently been on the spotlight following weeks of load shedding with Federation of Unions of South Africa (Fedusa) proposing that it be placed under business rescue as opposed to using public servants pension funds to bail out the ailing power utility. Fedusa said it rejects the proposal brought forward by the Congress of South African Trade Unions which suggests that the Public Investment Corporation should step in to take on $17 billion of Eskom’s debt. Challenges facing the power utility Eskom, have according to Ramaphosa negatively affected the economy.  “The load shedding of the last few months has had a debilitating effect on our country. It has severely set back our efforts to rebuild the economy and to create jobs. Every time it occurs, it disrupts people’s lives, causing frustration, inconvenience, hardship.”
