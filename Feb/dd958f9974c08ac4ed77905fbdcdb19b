Moi died on February 4 at a private hospital in the capital, Nairobi, of an unspecified illness. He was 95 years old. He was Kenya's longest-serving president after spending 24 years in power. President Uhuru Kenyatta, while announcing the death, said the former president would have a state funeral with full civilian and military ceremonial honours. On Thursday, Interior Minister Fred Matiangi announced that the holiday would "accord all Kenyans the opportunity to attend the national memorial service in honour" of the former President. Moi's body will lie in state for three days from Saturday at parliament before a memorial service on Tuesday at Nyayo stadium in the capital. He will be buried the next day at his home in Kabarak, located 270 kilometres north-west of Nairobi. Â
