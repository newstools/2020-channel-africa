Huawei Technologies Co Ltd once challenged Samsung’s top position in the global smartphone market, but the Chinese rival is in survival mode with United States (US) restrictions choking off its supplies of chips used in smartphones and telecom equipment. South Korean chip industry officials hope Joe Biden’s presidency will ease some of those restrictions, although they are far from certain as they also expect the incoming US administration to maintain a tough stance on China. Samsung is preparing to launch its new Galaxy S21 as early as late January 2020, whereas it previously launched its flagship S20 phone in early March 2020, the sources said, asking not to be identified because the plan is not public. Samsung Electronics declined to comment. The South Korean company shipped 59% fewer Galaxy S20 5G series handsets in the United States in the second quarter compared to the previous model's performance a year earlier, according to research firm Canalys. 

In contrast, Apple AAPL.O shipped 15% more of its flagship iPhone 11 than last year's best-seller, the iPhone XR. Samsung, which lost its number one position to Huawei in the second quarter, regained the crown in the third thanks in part to the US restrictions on Huawei.
