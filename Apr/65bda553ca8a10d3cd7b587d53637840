While countries across Africa have imposed curfews, partial and full lockdowns, Tanzania has resisted such measures. Schools and universities have been shut but markets, bus stops and shops bustle as usual. Magufuli, who called for three days of prayer from last Friday to fight the virus, is one of a handful of world leaders still brushing off the seriousness of the disease. "This is time to build our faith and continue praying to God and not depending on facemasks. Don't stop going to churches and mosques for prayers. I am sure this is just a change of wind and it will go like others have gone," Magufuli said at a church in Dodoma in March. He reiterated his message on Good Friday, last week, saying God would protect Tanzanians from the virus. Tanzania recorded its first case of coronavirus on March 16 and in the past week numbers have leapt from 32 to 147, with five deaths. African countries have lagged behind the global curve, and many took fast and strict measures to curb movement, however cases are rising across the continent. --News24--
