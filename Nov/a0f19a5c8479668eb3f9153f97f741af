The International Air Transport Association (IATA), which in June had forecast $100 billion in losses for the two-year period, said it now projects a $118.5 billion deficit this year alone, and a further $38.7 billion for 2021. The bleak outlook underscores challenges still facing the sector despite upbeat news on development of COVID-19 vaccines, whose global deployment will continue throughout next year. “The positive impact it will have on the economy and air traffic will not happen massively before mid-2021,” IATA Director General Alexandre de Juniac told Reuters. Passenger numbers are expected to drop to 1.8 billion this year from 4.5 billion in 2019, IATA estimates, and will recover only partially to 2.8 billion in 2021. 

Passenger revenue for 2020 is expected to have plunged 69% to $191 billion. The forecasts assume some re-opening of borders by the middle of 2021, helped by some combination of COVID-19 testing and vaccine deployment. IATA reiterated its call for governments to replace travel-stifling quarantine regimes with widespread testing programmes.
