Meanwhile, South Africa’s debt-strapped government committed to secure funds for the rescue of national carrier SAA, with an influx of at least R10 billion($600m) needed for the restructuring plan – this is in addition to the R16 billion($960m) set aside for the struggling parastatal in February.

At the close of local trade, the rand quoted 0.02% stronger at R16.64/$. Expected range today R16.60/$ - R16.90/$ --IOL--
