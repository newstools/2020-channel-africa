The company needs to raise $4.9 billion this year and $3 billion (R56 billion) of that will come from an existing state bailout, Chief Executive Officer, Andre de Ruyter, and Chief Financial Officer, Calib Cassim, said on the call, according to investors who listened to it. 

Eskom spokesperson, Sikonathi Mantshantsha, declined to comment. About 40% of the remaining funding required has been committed by development finance institutions; the balance will come in the form of structured products from banks, export-credit agencies and the sale of domestic bonds, the people said. They asked not to be identified as the call wasn’t open to the media. In a discussion dominated by investor concerns about cash flow, the executives said the company could withstand a few more weeks of a lockdown if it was extended. An estimated revenue loss of $280 million is anticipated for the three-week lockdown that began March 26, they said. The plunge in electricity demand due to the mandatory closure of mines and factories has allowed Eskom to boost maintenance to 9 500 megawatts of capacity from 9 000 megawatts. However, longer-term closures of plants for deeper maintenance will have to wait until the lockdown is lifted because the work would violate social distancing guidelines. --IOL--
