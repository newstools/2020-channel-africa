South Korea's Ko, who trailed her compatriot Kim Sei-young by a shot after Saturday's round, pulled away from the pack with five birdies over the last nine holes for 18 under. Kim and Australia's Hannah Green, who also shot 67, finished tied second. Georgia Hall was level par for the final round to end on 10 under. Fellow Englishwoman Charley Hull made a double bogey on the last hole for a 74 to finish at a seven under total. This was Ko's seventh win on the LPGA Tour, earning her $1.1 million. The 25-year-old was 2019's LPGA player of the year after winning two majors, the ANA Inspiration and the Evian Championship. --BBC--
