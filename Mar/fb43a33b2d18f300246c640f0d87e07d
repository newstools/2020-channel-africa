The latest cases involve a couple who had travelled from Spain's capital, Madrid, through Dubai, arriving on March 5. The other involved a Burundian national, who arrived from Dubai on March 17 and was isolated being found to have a high temperature at Kenya's main airport in the capital, Nairobi. Kagwe said the authorities were tracing all the people who came into contact with the three latest cases. Last week, Kenya blocked entry to all travellers coming from countries with reported cases, but Kenyan citizens, diplomats and foreigners with valid residence permits are allowed in. --BBC--
