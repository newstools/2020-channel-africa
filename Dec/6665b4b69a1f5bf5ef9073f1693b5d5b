Paul Rusesabagina, whose story during the 1994 genocide inspired the Hollywood film Hotel Rwanda, had been living in exile in the United States and Belgium. He says in August he intended to visit Burundi for a speaking engagement but when he boarded a private flight in Dubai he was instead flown to Rwanda. A civil lawsuit filed in Texas alleges that the charter company, GainJet, agreed to facilitate the journey because of its close relationship with officials in Kigali. A similar case is expected be lodged in Belgium where Rusesabagina holds citizenship. GainJet has not responded to the BBCâ€™s requests for comment. --BBC--
