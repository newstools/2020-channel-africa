The Northern Irishman set a new career-best of 29 birdies over 72 holes at the Zozo Championship at the weekend, but carded eight bogeys and three double bogeys to finish tied for 17. McIlroy gave himself a mountain to climb at Sherwood Country Club after a disastrous back nine on the opening day meant he dropped seven shots and fell nine behind the clubhouse leader. He recovered impressively with consecutive rounds of 67 before shooting 66 on Sunday, but by then he was too far behind to challenge the top of the leaderboard, with American Patrick Cantlay taking victory. World number five McIlroy hopes to becomes only the sixth player to win all four modern majors by triumphing at Augusta from 12-15 November. "Just limiting the mistakes more than anything else," he told Sky Sports when asked what he will be working on before the Masters. "I don't think it's anything technical, but yeah, mostly just I've sort of compounded errors this week a little bit, and last week as well.
