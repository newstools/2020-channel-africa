The country has already been under lockdown for two weeks and it was due to be lifted in a week. The President has said it will be extended because evidence suggested it was already limiting Covid-19's spread. But the Democratic Alliance (DA) says it was a "great mistake to think in terms of lives versus livelihoods. We would prefer a gradual phasing out of the current lockdown over the coming weeks‚Äù the party said in a statement. In a televised address to the nation on Thursday evening, President Cyril Ramaphosa said the decision to extend the strict restrictions had not been taken lightly. "I have to ask you to make even greater sacrifices so that our country may survive this crisis and so that tens of thousands of lives may be saved," he said. --BBC-
