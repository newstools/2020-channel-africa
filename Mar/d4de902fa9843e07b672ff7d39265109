India currently top the standings of the new championship introduced at the start of last year's Ashes, but with several qualification series' already scrapped, next year's final at Lord's might not be able to go ahead. The International Cricket Council (ICC) board will meet on Friday to discuss the matter. "At present, the ICC are considering the options available to us regarding the World Test Championship and no decisions have been taken," an ICC spokesperson said according to the Sydney Morning Herald. The ICC will also address the potential impact on the men's ICC World T20 Championship in Australia, which is due to start in October 2020. Both the ICC and Cricket Australia (CA) have made it clear they won't cede venues such as the MCG and SCG to the Australian Football League (AFL) should the football season in Australia carry through until December. "I would have thought that was very, very unlikely," a high-level ICC source was quoted as saying on Monday.
