Mkapa, the East African nation’s third President who led several regional peace mediation efforts in office and afterwards, died while receiving treatment at a hospital in Dar es Salaam, Magufuli said, without giving more details. He declared a seven day mourning period, during which all flags will be flown at half-mast. “Magufuli asks all Tanzanians to remain calm, patient and united during this difficult time,” a statement from his office said. Mkapa, 81, also served as an Ambassador, Minister and key official of the ruling CCM party, Magufuli said. --Reuters--
