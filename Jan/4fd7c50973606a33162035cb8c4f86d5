Williams, chasing a record-equalling 24th Grand Slam title, took the first set in 19 minutes in a 6-0 6-3 victory over Anastasia Potapova. Third seed Osaka started slowly against Marie Bouzkova before winning 6-2 6-4. World number one, Ashleigh Barty, and Britain's Johanna Konta are also in action on Monday. While Williams claimed a convincing victory over her Russian opponent in just 58 minutes, there was an even faster win for seventh seed Petra Kvitova, with the 2019 runner-up demolishing fellow Czech, Katerina Siniakova, 6-1 6-0 in 51 minutes. --BBC--
