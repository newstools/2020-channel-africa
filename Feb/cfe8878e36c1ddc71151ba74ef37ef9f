All are measures that could help rebuild ties with the West after decades of international isolation and help unlock urgently needed financial support for a reeling economy. But the steps all in the past month may not be enough. International donors are holding back, demanding more transparency on public and military spending, an economic reform plan, and the lifting of fuel subsidies estimated to cost about $3.5 billion a year. The risk, say some Sudanese, is that the economy could collapse without sufficient support, in turn fuelling political strife that could endanger prospects for a new era of democracy. It is unclear when substantial support could materialize. Potential donors from the West and the Gulf have met several times, but they have postponed from April to June a “Friends of Sudan” economic conference where pledges could be made. The United States has signaled that Sudan could be removed from a list of countries seen as state sponsors of terrorism, but has given no timeframe.
