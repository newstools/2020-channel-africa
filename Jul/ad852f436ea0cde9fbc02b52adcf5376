They received top honours at Cricket South Africa’s virtual awards ceremony. De Kock was also named Test Cricketer of the Year and the Players’ Player of the Year. Wolvaardt received the women’s One-Day International Cricketer of the Year award, as well as the Women’s Players’ Player of the Year. Lungi Ngidi was named men’s ODI and T20 Player of the Year. De Kock says he is excited about the young talent coming through the ranks. “Janneman Malan, Heinrich Klaasen, Lungi, after his injury coming through, Anrich Nortje, Temba, obviously, they know, they themselves want that responsibility to also be one of the better players in the team. “Not just better in the team, but one of the best in the world. That’s what they’re striving for and it’s good to have that around. I don’t think it’s healthy in a team where people are dependent on one or two players.” --SABC--
