Economists at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Renaissance Capital are projecting that countries with sizeable agriculture sectors and low exposure to tourism will recover quicker from the economic crisis fuelled by the pandemic. According to the IMF, the largest impact of the Covid-19 crisis on economic growth has been for tourism-dependent economies such as Mauritius, Seychelles, Cabo Verde, Comoros and the Gambia although commodity-exporting countries have also been hit hard as well. For tourism-dependent economies, the sector represents about 18% of gross domestic product (GDP) on average and plays a crucial role in supporting livelihoods, and makes up about 25% of total employment. Tourism is also an important source of fiscal revenue, making up 18% of income in the Seychelles; while foreign exchange averaged more than 46% of export receipts. Despite a global recovery across many sectors, tourist inflows are not expected to return to 2019 levels until 2023. “Growth in more diversified economies will slow significantly, but in many cases will still be positive in 2020,” the IMF said in its Economic Outlook report for sub-Saharan Africa released in October. “Oil exporting countries have also been hit hard, with an average contraction in 2020 projected at negative 4%, while non-oil commodity exporters are expected to contract by negative 4.6%.” Growth in more diversified economies such as Côte d’Ivoire and Rwanda will slow significantly, but will still be positive in 2020. --TheEastAfrican--
