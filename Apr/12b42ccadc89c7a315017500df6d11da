Health Minister, Zweli Mkhize, said five out of the seven patients who died had underlying medical conditions ranging from diabetes to hypertension. The country's confirmed cases of the virus have increased to 2 506. South Africa has been on a three-week lockdown during which the government has conducted mass screening and done over 90 000 coronavirus tests. The lockdown that was to end on Thursday has been extended until the end of April. The country has some of the most stringent lockdown restrictions in the world; no jogging outside, no sales of alcohol or cigarettes, no dog-walking, no leaving home except for essential trips and prison or heavy fines for law-breaking. --BBC--
