He told the Ugandan broadcaster NBS that if the pandemic is not brought under control by July, then plans to hold the elections in early 2021 would have to be reviewed. There are 122 confirmed cases of coronavirus in Uganda so far, with no deaths. Public gatherings including political rallies have already been banned as part of social distancing measures to halt the spread of the virus. At least 24 candidates have declared interest to challenge President Museveni and had started grassroot meetings. These have been put on hold because of coronavirus. The 38-year-old MP and musician Robert Kyagulanyi, popularly known as Bobi Wine, has emerged as a strong contender against President Museveni who has been in power since 1986. Some of the president's opponents have faced intimidation and arrests. Bobi Wine has been detained on several occasions and charged with treason. Retired General Henry Tumukunde, who announced plans to challenge his former ally, has also been charged with treason and is out on bail after spending nearly two months on remand. President Museveni said it is only opponents who mix politics and subversion who are arrested. --BBC--
