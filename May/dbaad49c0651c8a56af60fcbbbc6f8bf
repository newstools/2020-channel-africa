The musicians were contracted to a Turkish entertainment company and are in the Mediterranean town of Antalya. Some said they had been working there for over a year, while others were hired in March when the coronavirus pandemic reached Turkey. Turkey cancelled international flights in late March making it impossible for foreign citizens to leave the country. The musicians say the company has suspended their contracts due to the impact of coronavirus on business. The work permits of some members have also expired. The group's spokesperson, Thulasizwe Yaze from Port Elizabeth, told BBC News Turkish that they had been in touch with the South African embassy in Ankara for over a month for their request to be repatriated. "Every time they said they’ve been making an effort however those efforts were not yielding any results. It became a bit difficult for us to be patient so we took it to social media," said Yaze Their employer has said he can no longer provide them with food but would continue accommodating them, but Yaze is worried that may also come to an end soon. "Our biggest fear is that [coronavirus] cases here in Turkey are rising much higher than the cases we have in South Africa, so the feeling in the house is we would rather be at home than be here. "Our families are also trying to help us by calling authorities, they are worried. We just want to go home,” he said. BBC News Turkish has contacted the South African embassy in Ankara but has not yet received a response. --bbc--
