McIlroy fired a closing 68 at TPC Harding Park on Sunday to finish tied for 31st on two under, 11 strokes behind winner Collin Morikawa. McIlroy has now failed to contend in 16 of the last 20 majors, with nary a victory in sight, and he doesn't seem to have any idea why that is. "No, I don't know.Â 

Maybe I'm just not as good as I used to be!" he said with a wry smile."I don't know. I really don't know. I feel like the golf that I've played in the majors has been sort of similar to the golf I've played outside of them, and I've won some big events and played well and had a good season last season. "I can't really put my finger on it. I go out there and try my best every single day. Some days I play better than others, and just got to keep going and keep persisting and see if you can do better the next time." The three-hole stretch from the 12 to the 14 at TPC Harding Park proved McIlroy's undoing last week, as he played then in 10-over-par. --News24--
