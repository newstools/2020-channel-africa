This warning comes amid reports that some liquor outlets have continued selling alcohol despite the ban. Pillay says in the past the provincial liquor authority had suspended licences for between one and three months. The MEC says, “Stricter sanctions apply because of the severity of the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic. Furthermore, persons who are found trading in liquor illegally will also be entered into a database so that their actions are taking into consideration if they make applications for trading licences in the future. The primary aim of these regulations is to save lives by controlling the spread of infections.” Meanwhile, the Beer Association of South Africa (Basa) say while they acknowledge the severity of the Covid-19 second wave and the immense pressure on the healthcare system, they do not agree with the blanket alcohol ban announced by the President on Monday night.    

Basa CEO Patricia Pillay says the previous two bans had a devastating impact on the beer industry with 7 400 job cut.  

The South Africa Liquor Brand Association (SALBA) has also expressed concern over the total shutdown of liquor sales, saying the ban is an opportunity for illegal alcohol trade to go ahead.
