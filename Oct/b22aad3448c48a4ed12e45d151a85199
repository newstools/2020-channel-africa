The Deceuninck-Quick-Step sprinter, who won the green jersey at the Tour de France, muscled his way across the line first on the stage into Aguilar de Campoo, near Bilbao. But he was demoted after race commissaires said he shoulder-charged Emils Liepins of Trek-Segafredo. Germany's Pascal Ackermann of Bora-Hansgrohe inherited victory. Ineos Grenadiers' Richard Carapaz remains in the overall lead, with Britain's Hugh Carthy fourth. The 157.7 kilometres stage from Castrillo del Val near Burgos was a largely soporific race on wide, pan-flat roads. But Bennett showed the strength and efficiency which saw him win on the Champs-Elysees in Paris in September to finish a bike wheel ahead of Ackermann of Bora-Hansgrohe and Belgian Gerben Thijssen of Lotto-Soudal. But Bennett, who thought he had secured his 50th career win, said before his demotion he had been involved in a tussle with other riders before the final sprint. "It was slightly uphill and a headwind," said Bennett. "But we had to come from behind at speed. "There was a big fight with some guys who nearly put us in the barriers trying to take the wheel, so it was a bit sketchy trying to stay upright." In another incident during Thursday's stage Caja Rural's Hector Saez suffered a nasty fall in which his head struck the ground, shattering his helmet. He was checked over by officials and allowed to rejoin the race.
