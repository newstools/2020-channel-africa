The Governor of the capital, Gitega, Venant Manirambona also said songs "praising God" were allowed. Mbonimpa in a statement said leisure activities were suspended during the mourning period. He said secular music in bars, restaurants, hairdressing salons, cars and all other places of gathering was banned. Only wedding parties, funerals and mourning wakes are allowed, he said.
