The Lagos state emergency agency (Lasema) said the dead person was one of two passengers in an SUV that collided with a moving train in the Oshodi area on Monday morning. It is unclear how the accident happened, but it seems the three vehicles were trying to cross the rail track and were unable to make it in time. Two of the vehicles, the SUV and a minibus with six passengers, were then dragged for several metres along the rail track before the train came to a stop. Many sustained minor injuries and were treated on the scene but those seriously injured have been taken to hospital, Lasema said. The accident caused a two-hour delay on train services along the route, the BBCâ€™s Andre Gift reports from Lagos. Oshodi has the busiest bus stations in Lagos and is a major interchange for those coming from the suburbs and neighbouring states. --BBC--
