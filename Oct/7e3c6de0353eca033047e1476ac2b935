Kampala says it needs the revenue to meet its annual budget, while Nairobi says that the tax makes Kenyan-made goods more expensive in Uganda. Kenya has also complained that the unilateral tax by an EAC partner state is in breach of the Customs Union protocol. The EastAfrican has learnt that Kampala disregarded a bilateral agreement signed with Nairobi in December, as the Uganda Revenue Authority (URA) seeks to raise a total of $5.43 billion in domestic taxes to finance part of the $12.23 billion budget for the 2020/2021 fiscal year. Kenya's latest Economic Survey data shows that Uganda still remains Nairobi's leading export destination within the EAC and in Africa, but that the growth in the value of its exports to Uganda slowed down last year compared with the other EAC member states. The report shows that Kenya's exports to Uganda increased by 2.4 % to $641 million, lower than the value of its exports to Tanzania and Rwanda, which grew by 13 % and 29.9 % to $339 million and $232 million respectively during the period. Uganda accounted for 28.6 % of Kenya's $2.24 billion total exports to Africa. --TheEastAfrican--
