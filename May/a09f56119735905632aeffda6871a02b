This means the first-class competition, the Logan Cup, and the List A contest, the Pro50 Championship, have been voided, with no winners being declared. The premier domestic competitions - which were underway before the government suspended all sporting activities as part of nationwide restrictions aimed at curbing the spread of the novel virus that is ravaging the world - were originally supposed to be completed by the end of April. ZC Director of cricket Hamilton Masakadza said: "We were looking forward to the conclusion of our season, but seeing what is happening in our country and elsewhere across the world, we realised it was not realistic for us to expect our competitions to resume anytime soon. "ZC therefore decided to void the 2019/20 season with immediate effect and we will not declare a winner or award any of the trophies as teams had not played an equal number of games when the season was curtailed."
