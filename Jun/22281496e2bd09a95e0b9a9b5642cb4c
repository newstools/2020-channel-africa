Reports suggested that Napoli could be forced to drop their asking price due to the coronavirus pandemic which has come as a huge financial burden to most clubs across the world. Napoli sporting director Cristiano Giuntoli has dismissed those claims: “Kalidou is a great player, who still has a long contract with us. If we were to sell, the club could ask for a large sum. “A player like this cannot change his value even in a crisis, so we are not moving our valuation.” Koulibaly has established himself as one of the best defenders in world football over the last few seasons and has been named in the Serie A team of the season for the past four years. The 28-year-old has scored 10 goals in 233 appearances for Napoli and is contracted to the Italian club until 2023. --AfricaFootball--
