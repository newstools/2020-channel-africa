The match is set for the Loftus Versfeld Stadium in Pretoria, kick-off at 20:15 CAT. United famously defeated ‘Downs over two legs in the semifinals of the MTN8 earlier this season, triumphing 3-1 on aggregate, and the Brazilians will thus be looking to return the favour in this Tshwane derby. To some effect, Pitso Mosimane’s team have already paid Matsatsantsa back, defeating them in both league matches so far this season. In fact, Sundowns’ 2-1 away win over SuperSport last month, courtesy of goals from Themba Zwane and Thapelo Morena, was their last domestic outing. The Brazilians have been busy in the CAF Champions League since then, notably defeating Wydad Casablanca last weekend to finish top of their group and enter the quarterfinals as one of the seeded teams. SuperSport, meanwhile, have struggled for consistency and come into this clash on the back of two losses from their last three league outings. Their most recent setback was a 1-0 loss away to Golden Arrows last weekend, but coach Kaitano Tembo will hope his team enjoy the change of pace the Nedbank Cup brings. In addition, Matsatsantsa have been one of the top teams in the Nedbank Cup in recent years, with three trophies (2012, 2016 & 2017) and one runners-up finish (2013) in the space of eight seasons. In head-to-head terms, Sundowns and SuperSport have met in 15 cup matches dating back as far as 1993: the Brazilians have claimed eight wins compared to six for Matsatsantsa. Across all competitions, Sundowns’ dominance is more marked: 39 wins compared to 21 for United in 73 matches since 1990. --AllAfrica--
