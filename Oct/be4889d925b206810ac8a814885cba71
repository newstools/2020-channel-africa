That's according to President Emmerson Mnangagwa. Giving a State of the Nation Address and opening the third session of the ninth parliament, Mnangagwa stressed the need for unified action to accelerate development.

Government was keen to improve the working conditions of teachers, health workers and the public service in general as part of its overall policy of improving the lives of all citizens. This year the opening speech, where the President explains why Parliament was summoned, and his formal outline of the State of the Nation, was done virtually in keeping with measures aimed at preventing the spread of Covid-19. Mnangagwa said government was committed to improving the welfare of civil servants among other initiatives aimed at improving the general livelihoods of people. --Herald--
