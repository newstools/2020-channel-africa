With the tourists still needing three wickets in the final hour, man of the match Ben Stokes claimed them all to cap a stunning all-round performance. He removed Dwaine Pretorius and Anrich Nortje in consecutive balls before dismissing Vernon Philander to secure the win with just 8.2 overs remaining. The Proteas looked to be grinding their way to a draw, with opener Pieter Malan making a superb 84 off 288 balls on debut, before Rassie van der Dussen and Quinton de Kock resisted for almost 34 overs. England's attack was also limited with all-time highest Test wicket-taker James Anderson missing most of the last two sessions because of injury. But De Kock slapped a long hop from Joe Denly to mid-wicket to fall for 50 and Van der Dussen, who spent 140 balls over his 17, flicked Stuart Broad to leg gully. England's chance of victory was boosted but they still needed Stokes to seize it, the all-rounder finding seam movement and bounce in a devastating spell to secure the tourists' first win at Newlands since 1957. The third Test of the four-match series starts in Port Elizabeth on 16 January. --BBC--
