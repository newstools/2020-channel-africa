Nigerian authorities have urged the public to remain calm. But some people say they fear the country, which is already battling an outbreak of Lassa fever, may struggle to cope if coronavirus spreads.

Others say that the quick response of health authorities to the 2014 Ebola outbreak is proof the country will be able to contain the threat. Nigerians are also encouraging each other to take basic preventive measures to protect themselves, such as washing hands. That's one of the key steps recommended by the World Health Organization. Nigeria is the first country in sub-Saharan to record a positive case of coronavirus, after authorities confirmed an Italian citizen, who flew into Lagos from Milan, tested positive for the disease. Egypt and Algeria have also recorded positive cases.
