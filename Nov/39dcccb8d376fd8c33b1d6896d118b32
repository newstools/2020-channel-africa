The proposed transaction will see Kenya’s biggest lender by assets acquire Banque Populaire du Rwanda Plc (BPR) and the African Banking Corporation Tanzania (BancABC), strengthening its business in the two countries. Under the proposed deal KCB will acquire a 62.06% stake in Banque Populaire du Rwanda Plc and a 100% stake in African Banking Corporation Tanzania. The transaction is subject to obtaining shareholder and regulatory approvals in Rwanda and Tanzania. In a statement, Oigara said the transaction is part of KCB’s "on-going strategy to explore opportunities for new growth while investing in and maximising returns from the Group’s existing businesses." The acquisition, he added, will buttress the Group’s leadership position and give it a stronger edge to play a bigger role in driving the financial inclusion agenda in the East African region while building a robust and financially sustainable organization. “The transaction fits within the Group’s expansion strategy and will see us increase our market share and distribution network across Rwanda and Tanzania and improve our operating leverage by enabling us to deliver our existing product offerings to a wider base of customers while positioning the bank for sustainable growth in the long-term,” Oigara said. “Once the transaction is completed, the Group’s Rwanda and Tanzania businesses are expected to have stronger financial credentials to support business growth in the post Covid-19 macroeconomic recovery.” In Rwanda the acquisition is expected to see KCB double its market share to become the second largest bank in the country and solidify KCB Group’s leadership position. In Tanzania, the subsequent merger of BancABC with KCB Bank Tanzania, a subsidiary of KCB Group, will integrate KCB Tanzania’s strong retail and corporate banking franchise with BancABC’s retail and commercial banking operations. The merged entity is expected to rank as a top ten bank in the industry. --TheEastAfrican--
