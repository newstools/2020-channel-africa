The company said it would continue to expand its operations in Uganda and Nigeria. SafeBoda said it was unclear when the economy would recover from the pandemic and that transport had been hit hard. The company advised customers to utilise their e-wallet balances by requesting rides until November 27. Kenyans online have expressed concern at the news. "Companies like this are the ones putting food on the tables of citizens and they should be accorded protection during Covid-19," tweeted Yipe, which lists itself as a promoter of entrepreneurialism. "This makes me truly sad. I loved SafeBoda. The fact that I could comfortably wear the helmet was my favourite part. I actually felt safe on a boda," customer, Elizabeth Moturi, tweeted. --BBC--
