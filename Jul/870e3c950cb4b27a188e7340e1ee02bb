The Clever Boys will cease to exist next season following their sale to Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM). Hunt will be out of a job and the vast number of current Wits players are expected to leave. With the 2016/17 PSL winners still in the Nedbank Cup and just 10 points from league leaders Kaizer Chiefs, with nine games to play, Hunt is hopeful of finishing the season on high. Speaking to TimesLIVE, the former SuperSport league winner said: "We're still right there in the league. "Anything can happen in this period. And with the strange circumstances you'll see some strange results. I think the most important thing is that we have to finish the season." Hunt added that despite returning to training, it will take some time for his players to regain their fitness levels. We're not ready to play‚ but we have to play. And the sooner that it's done‚ and the sooner we can have a break and get everything formalised again the better," he said. "I've been pushing for the start of the season for weeks now‚ even without much preparation." --News24--
