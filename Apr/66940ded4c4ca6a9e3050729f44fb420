More than 10, 000 delegates including heads of state, British Prime Minister and the Prince of Wales were expected to attend the 26th summit in the capital Kigali in just about two months. A new date has not been announced. This was going to be the first time for the summit to be held in a country that has no colonial links with the United Kingdom. Rwanda, which was formerly a Belgian colony, joined the Commonwealth in 2009. The theme for this year’s meeting was "Delivering a common future through connecting, innovating and transforming". Leaders from the organisation’s 54 member states were also expected to decide whether to reappoint the current Secretary General Baroness Patricia Scotland. Rwanda has extended its lockdown until early May and put in place stringent measures, including cancelling major public events.
