President Magufuli is seeking a second five-year term amid concerns of increased repression of opposition parties. Magufuli has not yet responded to the challenge. Lissu, the leader of Chadema party, said a televised debate of the presidential candidates will be "healthy for the country's democracy". He told a campaign rally that President Magufuli shouldn't be afraid of debating a person who has never been a President like him. --BBC--
