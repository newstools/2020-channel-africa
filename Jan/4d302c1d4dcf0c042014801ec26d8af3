Ceballos joined Arsenal in August on a season-long loan, but he has struggled to make an impact and is reportedly keen to leave. The 23-year-old played in Spain's most recent internationals but is said to be concerned about his chances of making the national squad for Euro 2020. Ceballos, who has scored just once in 17 appearances for Arsenal, was sidelined by a hamstring injury in November and is yet to feature since Arteta took charge. Speaking ahead of Monday's FA Cup fourth round tie at Bournemouth, Arteta made it clear Ceballos will have to show his quality and desire on a consistent basis to get back in the team. "I had a conversation with Dani. When I joined the club he wasn't here. He was in Madrid because he was doing his rehab for over a month with the team that owns him," Arteta told reporters on Friday. "I haven't seen much of him because he only trained with us for a week or 10 days. "It's very early to assess what I can or cannot do with him. I heard about all those things but I have nothing to comment. "He needs to get back to fitness and fight for his place like any other player. After that we will make a selection that is fair with what I see on the pitch." Ceballos wasn't the only Arsenal player linked with a move this week after Barcelona were connected with a potential bid for Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to cover for the injured Luis Suarez.
