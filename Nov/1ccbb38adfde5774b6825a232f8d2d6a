Zuma had tried to get Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo removed from the inquiry, accusing him of bias. But when that bid failed the former president and his lawyer did not return to face questions. At least 34 witnesses have directly or indirectly implicated Zuma. He has denied any wrongdoing. The commission, which has been hearing testimony since 2018, said it would also urgently approach South Africa's highest court, the Constitutional Court, in an effort to compel Zuma to comply with the summons.
