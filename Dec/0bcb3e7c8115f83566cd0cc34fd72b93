Positive tests from the commercial hub Lagos and the capital, Abuja, accounted for a lot of the new cases. Nigeria has so far confirmed a total of 75 062 cases and 1 200 deaths. But despite the increase in number of cases and authorities warning that the country might be experiencing a second wave, attitudes towards large gatherings and using of face masks in public has not changed, says the BBC's Nduka Orjinmo in Lagos. Testing is still low and most people have plans to travel next week for the holidays despite authorities warning against such trips. There have been concerns that the continent is facing another spike in infections, with some of its most populous countries seeing increases in Covid-19 cases since late September. South Africa is officially experiencing a second wave, accounting for more than 60% of daily new cases detected in sub-Saharan Africa. --BBC--
