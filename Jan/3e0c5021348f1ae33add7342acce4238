Cottrell, best known for his fast bowling where wickets are celebrated with a flamboyant military salute, carted Mark Adair over cover for the winning runs as the home side lived on their nerves to finish on 242-9. Victory gave the West Indies a 2-0 lead in the three-game series after winning the opener at the same ground on Tuesday by five wickets. Despite Cottrell's headline-stealing flourish, it was fellow tail-ender Hayden Walsh who was his team's saviour. In just his seventh one-dayer, Walsh, who started his international career last year playing for the United States, finished undefeated on 46. "We are relieved about the win, we all put in the effort," said West Indies man of the match Alzarri Joseph who took four wickets for the second game in a row as well as hitting a valuable 16 runs in a ninth-wicket stand with Walsh. "We wanted to bat sensibly and get to the score. The win means a lot to everyone, but it's not finished, we have one game to go." West Indies had been cruising at 140-3 at one stage in pursuit of a 238-run target. However, a brief rain delay played havoc with their composure and three quick wickets fell for just eight runs. --News24--
