Oil is off more than 20% from peaks struck in January after a spreading virus hit demand in the world’s largest oil importer and fuelled concerns of excess supplies. Brent crude LCOc1 slipped to $53.63 a barrel in early Asian trade, the lowest since January 2019, before recovering to $54.37 by 0517 GMT, down 10 cents. United States (US) West Texas Intermediate CLc1 fell 8 cents to $50.24 a barrel after striking a low of $49.56. “The overall sentiment is still bearish but markets are oversold,” said Avtar Sandu, a senior commodities manager at Phillips Futures in Singapore. He added traders took profit after prices hit technical support levels. Beijing has orchestrated support for its companies and financial markets in the past week and investors are hoping for more stimulus to lift the world’s second-biggest economy. “Normally it takes at least two quarters before things start to pick up but there’s always hope for new stimulus in the market that will buoy the economy,” Sandu said. Worries over supply were not alleviated on Friday when Russia said it needed more time to decide on a recommendation from a technical committee that has advised the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies to cut production by a further 600 000 barrels per day.
