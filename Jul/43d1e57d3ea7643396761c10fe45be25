The study warns the concentrations can be so high that they stop the development of the brain, heart and other vital organs. The lead comes mainly from inadequately recycled waste, like batteries, and industries such as mining and open-air smelters. Africa and South Asia are the worst affected regions. The researchers call for urgent action to stop children being poisoned on what they say is a massive and previously unrecognised scale. The research was carries out by the United Nationâ€™s Children's Fund, UNICEF, and the environmental group, Pure Earth. --BBC--
