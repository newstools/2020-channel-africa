Three people were killed and dozens injured on Tuesday in an opposition stronghold according to local authorities quoted by news agencies. The clashes were reported in the south-central town of M’Batto seen as loyal to opposition candidate Pascal Affi N’Guessan, who was arrested on Friday. N’Guessan is facing charges of terrorism and sedition after rejecting President Ouattara's re-election and announcing the establishment of a parallel government. President Ouattara had invited his rival, former President Henri Konan Bédié, for talks following violence.  Bédié is yet to respond to the invitation.
