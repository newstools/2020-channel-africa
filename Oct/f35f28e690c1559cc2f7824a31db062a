A frustrated EU and piqued Britain both exhorted each other on Tuesday to compromise to avoid a fast-approaching disruptive finale to the five-year Brexit drama that would add to economic pain from the coronavirus crisis. “Time is very short and we stand ready to negotiate 24/7, on all subjects, on legal texts. The United Kingdom has a bit of a decision to make and it’s their free and sovereign choice,” European Council President, Charles Michel, told the European Parliament. “Their sovereign answer will determine the level of access to our internal market, this is just common sense.” Michel said the 27 EU members were equally ready for an abrupt split in trading ties at the end of the year without a new partnership agreement to avoid tariffs or quotas from 2021. “Brexit means Brexit, as (former British prime minister) Theresa May used to say. But Brexit also means making choices about our future relationship,” said Michel, enumerating the three sticking points in the trade negotiations: fishing rights, the settlement of disputes and economic fair play. “We don’t need words, we need guarantees,” he said of the so-called level playing field guarantees for fair competition. “Do our British friends want to regulate state aid and uphold high medical standards? If so, why not commit to them.” --Reuters--
