Tanzania exported fish and fish products worth over $299 million during the 2018/19 financial year, up from $163 million in the 2015/16 financial year,Â according to Fisheries Minister Luhaga Mpina. In an effort to attract more public and private sector investors, the government has passed new fishing regulations that are aimed at boosting production, stimulating local and international markets and cutting operational costs. According to Mpina, the government had embarked into major reforms which have been reflected in an increased production of both fisheries and livestock by-products. Presenting the ministry's performances under the first five-year term of President John Magufuli administration, the minister said the government has been able to repeal over 50 laws, rules and regulations and further reduced a total of 85 charges with the view to boost productivity and competitiveness. --AllAfrica--
