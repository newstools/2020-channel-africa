On Tuesday, Cricinfo reported that an attempt will be made to persuade Nenzani leave his position at CSA. Nenzani is one of the longest serving CSA members after his appointment in February 2013 with his tenure expected to end in September this year. According to the cricket publication, president of the Gauteng Cricket Board, Jack Madiseng - who resigned from the CSA board in December - is understood to have lobbied enough support to succeed Nenzani. The process to vote a sitting president out of office requires support from two-thirds of the Members' Council, which equates to 10 of the 14 presidents being in favour of the motion. The past few months have seen CSA experience one of the most uncertain periods in their administrative history. Former CEO CSA Thabang Moroe was suspended and held accountable for the governance crisis, while the president, Vice-President and current directors remained in office.
