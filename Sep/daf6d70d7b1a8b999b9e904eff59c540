Initial claims for state unemployment benefits totaled a seasonally adjusted 870 000 for the week ended September 19, compared to 866 000 in the prior week, the Labor Department said on Thursday. 

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 840 000 applications in the latest week. Claims are above their 665 000 peak during the 2007-2009 Great Recession, though applications have dropped from a record 6.867 million at the end of March.   

While the reopening of businesses in May boosted activity, demand in the services industries has remained lackluster, keeping layoffs elevated. Job cuts have also spread to industries such as financial services and technology that were not initially impacted by the mandated business closures in mid-March because of insufficient demand. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers on Wednesday that Congress and the US central bank needed to “stay with it” in working to support the economy’s recovery.     

In addition to cutting interest rates to near zero and vowing to keep borrowing costs low for a while, the Fed has also been pumping money into the economy.
