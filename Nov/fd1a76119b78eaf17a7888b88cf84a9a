AU President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa on Friday appointed former Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano, former Liberian President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, and former South African President Kgalema Motlanthe as special envoys to mediate in the crisis. But a senior adviser to Ethiopia's prime minister has told the BBC the three former presidents will only meet Abiy. “Tigray is currently under military operation. We believe that the military operation will come to an end soon. If this disgruntled TPLF wants to bring an end to the current conflict all they need to do is to peacefully surrender and for that nobody needs to go to Tigray or Mekelle to make that clear to them", said Mamo Mihretu. He said the government had been clear it would not negotiate with criminals. “I think our African brothers and sisters would play even more significant role if they put pressure on TPLF to surrender." He said the envoys will be updated by the prime minister on the on-going operation. Abiy gave the forces in Tigray 72 hours to surrender as government troops advance on the capital, Mekelle. --BBC--
