Kipruto, who’s personal best is eight minutes 0.12 seconds, said he was in great shape ahead of the event and hoped to break the world record which is currently held by Kenyan-born Qatari Saif Saaeed Shaheen (7:53.63). “Our World is going through a challenging period and we all have to take our responsibilities,” Kipruto said on Instagram. “Unfortunately my COVID-19 test, as part of the Monaco-protocol, came back positive and therefore I can’t be part of the Monaco Diamond League on August 14. “I don’t have any symptoms and I was actually in great shape. I was planning to go for the world record. It has stayed too long outside Kenya.” The Monaco Diamond League meeting will be followed by events in Stockholm, Lausanne, Brussels, Rome/Naples, Doha, and a yet to be determined location in China. Meetings in Eugene, London, Paris, Rabat, Gateshead, and Shanghai have been cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. --News24--
