Authorities had previously said the explosion was aimed at killing Abiy, who had taken office about two months earlier. Two people were killed in the blast at the rally attended by thousands of people in the capital. The prime minster was unharmed, and was whisked away immediately after the blast. One of those convicted, Tilahun Getachew, was sentenced to life in prison, state run EBC reports. Four of his co-accused received sentences ranging from five to 23 years.
