President Abdelmadjid Tebboune was elected last month and appointed Abdelaziz Djerad as prime minister on Saturday. They have kept several important posts unchanged, seemingly signaling continuity in major state policies. Abderrahmane Raouia was re-appointed finance minister, after previously serving in that post from 2017 until last March, when he was replaced. As is usual in Algeria, Tebboune will act as defense minister. Mass protests that broke out in February succeeded in unseating veteran president Abdelaziz Bouteflika in April. An election to replace him was postponed twice as protesters said it would be illegitimate while the ruling elite stayed in place. Tebboune was elected last month in a vote that the protest movement rejected, winning 58% on a turnout officially registered as 40%. He has offered dialogue with the protesters but the leaderless movement has continued to stage demonstrations since his election. Algeria, a major energy exporter, depends on its oil and gas sales for 60% of government revenue. However, sales have fallen since oil prices began to drop in 2014 and Algeriaâ€™s foreign currency reserves have more than halved since then. A state budget agreed by the interim government and parliament late last year included new laws aimed at increasing foreign investment but pledged 9% cuts in public spending.
