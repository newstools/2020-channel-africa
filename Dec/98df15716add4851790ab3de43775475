Donald Trump's trade chief Robert Lighthizer told the BBC on Wednesday that the WTO needs "someone with real experience in trade". The United States (US) opposes former World Bank economist Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala for the job. A consensus still hasn't been reached. The doubling down on the rejection of Okonjo-Iweala, despite widespread support from other countries, escalates one of the most pressing global trade issues Joe Biden will have to solve as US President. The other finalist for one of the top jobs in international trade is South Korea's Trade Minister Yoo Myung-hee, and the pair have been left in limbo for more than five weeks. 

Trump's top official on trade, US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer's remarks on Wednesday to the BBC in his first international interview confirm that there is no way the Trump administration will be persuaded to back the Nigerian former-finance minister in its remaining weeks in office.
