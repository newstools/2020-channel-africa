Juventus are preparing to make a world record bid for France and Paris St-Germain forward Kylian Mbappe, 21, next summer. Arsenal's German midfielder Mesut Ozil, 31, turned down the chance to leave the Gunners and earn £200,000 per week in the Saudi Professional League earlier in October. Germany defender Antonio Rudiger, 27, says he wants to win back his place at Chelsea after a move away from the club did not materialise over the summer. Former Juventus manager Massimiliano Allegri would be a candidate to replace Ole Gunnar Solskjaer if the Manchester United boss is sacked. Liverpool and Switzerland forward Xherdan Shaqiri, 29, says it was his choice to stay at the club during the summer, despite being linked away from the Premier League champions. Juventus are looking to renew Argentina forward Paulo Dybala's contract, with Chelsea considering a move for the 26-year-old. Manchester United did not submit any bids for Bayern Munich and France forward Kingsley Coman, 24, during the summer window, says the German club's sporting director Hasan Salihamidzic. Arsenal and Bosnia-Herzegovina defender Sead Kolasinac, 27, has been offered to Roma.
