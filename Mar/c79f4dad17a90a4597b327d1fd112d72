On Monday, a high-powered Government delegation, led by Local Government and Public Works Minister July Moyo, toured the country’s biggest stadium to assess areas which were flagged by CAF inspectors, before committing to upgrade the facility. And yesterday, artisans were on the ground, attending to the pitch, whose condition was condemned by the CAF inspectors. Acting Youth, Sport, Arts and Recreation Minister Kazembe Kazembe told journalists during a post-Cabinet briefing that renovations at the National Sports Stadium had started and was confident it could be upgraded, in the next two weeks, to bring it in line with CAF expectations. Work is also expected to start at Barbourfields, the stadium which was originally set to host the match against Algeria, and has the best possible chance of being refurbished in time for that showdown, given it has fewer requirements to pass the CAF test compared to other grounds in the country. Minister Kazembe said the Government was targeting to complete the renovations within the next two weeks and only the installation of bucket seats and electronic turnstiles were likely to be outstanding. “We are trying to, at least, meet the deadline as we address the issues and concerns raised by CAF. We are trying to address those issues within the next two weeks. There are only two issues which we may fail to attend to, that is the issue of bucket seats and the electronic turnstiles. “But, as we speak now, work has started at the National Sports Stadium following the meeting of stakeholders yesterday (Monday). “The pitch is being attended to, the floodlights have already been attended to and are awaiting inspection. --Herald--
