The West African country has been hit by rolling protests since mid-October over concerns President Alpha Conde plans to stay in office for a third term. Wearing the opposition colour red, protesters carried placards reading “No to a new constitution” and “No to a third mandate for Alpha Conde”. Conde, 81, announced a new draft constitution last month, but which critics fear he will use to pursue a third term. About 20 people have died since the protests began, according to an AFP tally, and one gendarme has also been killed. --AfricaNews--
