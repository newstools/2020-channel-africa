President Roch Kaboré, who is seeking a second term, and opposition leader, Zephirin Diabre, were among those allowed to contest. Others include the former ruling Congress for Democracy and Progress party's candidate, Eddie Komboigo. The constitutional court did not clear one candidate, Kindo Harouna, because he did not pay the required nomination fee. Eight presidential candidates and 22 opposition parties signed an agreement in August to rally behind any candidate who will reach the second round of the elections to boost chances of unseating Kaboré. --BBC—
