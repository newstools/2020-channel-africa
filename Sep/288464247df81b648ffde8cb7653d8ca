This follows a recent controversy over an online ad by retail giant, Clicks which showed images of black women’s hair being described as frizzy, dry and damaged and a white woman’s hair as fine, flat and normal. Speaking in a virtual 2020 National Heritage Day keynote address, Ramaphosa has called on firms to be mindful of people of all races and cultures. Ramaphosa says, “We must stand firm against attempts to disrespect our country’s women through crude forms of representation in the media, advertising and popular culture. The offensive hair advert that was recently published shows that we still have a long way to go. It is disheartening to see in this democratic SA, there are still crude stereotypes of black women being put on public display. The social coercion we seek in this country means we must be mindful of the legacy of our past.”
