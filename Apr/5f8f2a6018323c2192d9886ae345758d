“But let’s be frank, it doesn’t generate enough income. If we want to develop this Club World Cup, we have to find dates. Without the Champions Cup, nine weekends are available.” In a statement issued on Monday, the South African Future Trust (SAFT) said that it had received over 10 000 applications from small, medium and micro enterprises since applications opened on  April 3. "Our partner banks – ABSA, FNB, Nedbank, and Standard Bank – began processing applications on Friday 3rd April. The first applications were approved over the weekend, with the first payments reaching SMME employees over the course of today," the statement read. The SAFT expects to approve in excess of $13.57m loans over the next 48 hours. "This would equate to over 20 000 individuals already benefitting from SAFT support." Nicky and Jonathan Oppenheimer pledged $54m to support small medium and micro enterprises at the end of March, shortly after government announced a 21-day lockdown to curb the spread of the coronavirus. The South African Future Trust was formally established with an initial $54m in support, the Oppenheimers said. The SAFT partnered with four major banks, namely Absa, Absa, FirstRand Bank, Nedbank and Standard Bank, and clients of these banks can apply for funding. "The SAFT will transfer funds directly to employees of participating small medium and micro enterprises (SMMEs), via interest-free loans where employees themselves carry no liability," an initial statement read.
