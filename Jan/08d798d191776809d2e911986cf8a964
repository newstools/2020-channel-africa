Zomato, valued at around $3 billion after raising money from Ant in January, will take over Uber Eats’ operations from Tuesday. Since launching in India in 2017, Uber Eats has struggled to gain market share and is a distant third to Tencent Holdings (0700.HK)-backed Swiggy and Zomato. All three have spent heavily on deals and discounts to attract customers in a highly competitive market. Uber chief financial officer Nelson Chai said the move was another demonstration, following its decision to exit Uber Eats South Korea in October 2019, “of our commitment to take a hard look at Eats markets where we do not have a path to leadership”. The San Francisco-based firm, which has promised to be profitable at an operational level by the end of 2021, has been trying to sell the India Eats business for a year, three sources familiar with the talks told Reuters. It earlier held talks with Swiggy for a similar deal, but those fell through due to valuation and regulatory issues, two of them said. Uber and Swiggy did not respond to requests for comment.
