The South African currency oscillated sideways as investors weighed the impact of the coronavirus, while a poor outlook for the local economy added further pressure as more analysts vocalised concerns of a loss of the investment rating, according to NKC Research.

At the close of local trade, the rand quoted 0.27 % weaker at R14.40/$, after trading in range of R14.30/$ - R14.46/$. The local unit began the week on a softer footing as many Asian markets remain closed for Lunar New Year. Expected range today R14.35/$ - R14.55/$.

The JSE All Share (+0.64%) recovered from a global sell-off last week Friday, as fears of the China virus subsided somewhat, led by gains in large technology (+1.39%) and retail (+1.70%) stocks. 

In the overall emerging market sphere, the MSCI Emerging Market Index (-0.25%) traded.
