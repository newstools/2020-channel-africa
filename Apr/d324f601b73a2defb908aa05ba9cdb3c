Minister Angie Motshekga said it was disheartening to see criminals destroy the children's infrastructure with "apparent impunity". Equipment has been stolen in some of the affected schools and the minister urged locals not to buy the stolen property. She said the ministry was working with the police boss to fast-track arrests in all affected areas and urged the public to assist by reporting suspects. There has been increased crime in the country that is currently on a three-week lockdown to reduce the spread of coronavirus. President Cyril Ramaphosa said it was "despicable" that criminals were taking advantage of the lockdown when all state agencies were focused on the coronavirus pandemic.
