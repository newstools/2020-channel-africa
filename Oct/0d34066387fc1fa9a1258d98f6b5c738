The court said Aden Mohamed, who was born in Wajir, Kenya, fought for an IS affiliate in Somalia since 2017 and was arrested this year. He was sentenced with two other Somali nationals over attacks in Puntland state. Abshir Mohamed was sentenced to death, while Mohamud Shiniyow will serve 20 years in prison, according to Garowe. The three convicts can still appeal against the sentences. A number of Kenyan youths have been reported to have crossed the border with Somalia and join terror groups. Both countries have had attacks staged by al-Shabab terror group. --BBC--
