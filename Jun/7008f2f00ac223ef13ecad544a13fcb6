The NEC members have dismissed Ria Ledwaba and Gay Mokoena from their posts as Vice-Presidents. The unanimous decision was taken during the NEC meeting on Saturday. Xolile Nkompela and Premier Soccer League Chairperson, Irvin Khoza, are now the only remaining SAFA Vice-Presidents. “There was the issue of the letter that Ledwaba sent to the Minister and South African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee (SASCOC) and the President had sent to her an e-mail requesting her to submit the letter.” “In the meeting, they asked her to explain the letter of which she confessed that she sent the letter. She should have spoken to CAF or FIFA if she felt that the association is not doing right,” says Acting SAFA Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Teboho Motlanthe, while explaining what led to Ledwaba’s sacking as Vice-President. Mokoena wrote an open letter to the SAFA NEC in April, alleging that, among other things, SAFA President Danny Jordaan was taking decisions without consulting other NEC members. Mokoena served as SAFA’s acting CEO after the departure of Russell Paul, who is now working with the 2022 FIFA World Cup Organising Committee. Motlanthe says members of the NEC were not happy with Mokoena’s letter. “On Mokoena, it was the question of his report. The NEC was not happy that they had to first see it on the media….they then decided that he must be removed as Vice President.” Ledwaba and Mokoena are still members of SAFA’s NEC. However, Ledwaba is unhappy with how she was removed. --SABC--
