The previously announced target is part of efforts by Egypt, the worldâ€™s largest wheat importer, to increase the area used for growing strategic crops and improve food security, said Abbas al-Shennawi, head of services and follow-up at the ministry. Egypt harvested 8.5 million tons of domestic wheat from around 3.16 million feddans last season. Its current planting season began in mid-November. --Reuters--
