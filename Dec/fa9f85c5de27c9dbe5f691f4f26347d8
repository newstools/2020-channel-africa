As a second wave of COVID-19 is officially declared to have hit South Africa, the nation’s teenagers are being blamed for its spread. The Health Minister said most of the new surge of infections was affecting those aged between 15 and 19. It began in one crowded nightclub in Cape Town. The next super-spreader event was at a university in Nelson Mandela Bay. And now comes a series of crowded parties to celebrate the end of school exams, and the school year. The result, it’s now clear, is that South Africa’s teenagers are driving a second wave of infections. Health Minister, Zweli Mkhize, said 15 to 19 year olds were the worst hit, and he blamed drunken parties, where people ignored social distancing rules and the need to wear masks. The infection rate in some areas is now rising more steeply than during the country’s first wave, back in July. Other African nations, including Zimbabwe and Kenya, are also reporting new surges of infections. This continent, with its young population, and some tough lockdown measures, has been spared the worst of the pandemic so far. But there are concerns about a second wave, and about whether Africa will be at the back of the queue for vaccines. --BBC--
