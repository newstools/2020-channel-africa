The United Nations Children’s Fund is negotiating the advance purchase under the deal led by UNITAID and Wellcome, as part of the World Health Organisation’s plan to accelerate access to therapeutics, a joint statement said. “With this advanced purchase we aim to ensure equitable access for low- and middle-income countries for treatment of COVID-19 with the life-saving drug dexamethasone, and avoid shortages resulting from high-levels of demand from other parts of the world,” said Philippe Duneton, Acting Executive Director of UNITAID. --Reuters--
