US Tennis Association Chief Executive Mike Dowse said nothing "is off the table" and a final decision on the fate of the event would come in June but having fans attend the event is still their goal. "Playing without spectators, we are not taking anything off the table. But right now that's a highly unlikely scenario," said Dowse. "That's not in the spirit of celebration of tennis." Dowse's comments come as the National Tennis center's indoor courts in New York were being used as a makeshift hospital facility to treat those affected by the coronavirus pandemic. While the indoor tennis courts have been turned into a hospital zone, the Louis Armstrong Stadium has been transformed into a meal assembly area for patients, volunteers and area schoolkids. New York remains the hardest-hit area in America with over 31 000 dead, including 10 800 in New York City. More than 640 000 Americans have been infected with COVID-19.

"We're very fortunate that we're the fourth Grand Slam to go, so time is on our side at this point," Dowse said. "Obviously our ambition is to run the tournament. --News24--
