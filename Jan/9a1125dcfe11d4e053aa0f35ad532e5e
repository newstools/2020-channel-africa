The Wolverhampton Wanderers attacker has attracted wide-spread interest in recent months for a run of eye-catching displays which included three goals in two wins over Manchester City. Such has been his form that both the Citizens and Liverpool have reportedly added him to their respective transfer wish lists. The 23-year-old is finally starting to live up to expectations following his £18m move from Middlesborough in August 2018, with Wolves said to be demanding upwards of £70 million for his signature. Born in Spain, Traore came through the ranks at Barcelona’s famed La Masia academy. He joined Aston Villa from Barcelona B in 2015, before moving on to Boro and eventually Wolves. He has scored five and assisted seven goals across all competitions this season, while also earning a call-up to the Spanish national squad before injury denied him of making his debut. Traore can also represent Mali at international level and is yet to fully commit his allegiance to either of the two nations. --AfricaNews--
