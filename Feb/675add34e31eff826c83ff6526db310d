One car-manufacturing plant VW operates with SAIC in Shanghai and most of the plants in the FAW joint venture will restart on February 10, the German automaker said in an emailed statement on Saturday. VW said it was facing supply chain challenges as China goes back to work after the extended Lunar New Year holiday, as well as limited travel options for its employees.
