The tax requires customers to pay 33% of the cost of each phone they buy if the importer did not pay the corresponding customs dues. It is a controversial decision that has sparked condemnation by consumer associations who are calling on the government to force importers to pay the tax instead of consumers. The President of the National League of Cameroonian Consumers, Delor Magellan Kamgain, has called on consumers to boycott the tax. “The Cameroon government did not respect the procedures for implementing this decision. The government also did not carry out campaigns to inform consumers,” he said. But the Minister of Telecommunications, Minette Libom Li Keng, insists it is not a new tax, but just a change in the manner in which it is paid. --BBC--
