On Thursday, all parliamentarians and President Mokgweetsi Masisi were asked to quarantine for 14 days after a health worker who had been screening them for the coronavirus herself tested positive. However, a government statement said some of the MPs had regrettably been seen shopping in supermarkets. They have been moved from their homes to a supervised government facility. The statement did not say how many lawmakers had broken the rules. Botswana has reported 13 coronavirus cases and one death. --BBC-
