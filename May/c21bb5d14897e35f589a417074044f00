The Johannesburg-listed miner said it expected the Anglo Converter Plant and full downstream processing operations to be fully operational at its Phase B unit from May 12, while repairs would continue at its Phase A unit. The damage to the processing facilities forced Amplats, one of the world’s largest platinum producers, to declare force majeure and cut its production outlook. “As we complete the ramp-up, we are engaging with suppliers of concentrate to lift force majeure imminently. All temporary commercial arrangements applicable during the force majeure period will revert to normal commercial terms,” Anglo American Platinum Chief Executive Ofiicer(CEO) Natascha Viljoen said. Amplats said the force majeure notice would remain for the time being for its refined metal customers due to the time taken to refine the respective platinum group and base metals. --Reuters--
