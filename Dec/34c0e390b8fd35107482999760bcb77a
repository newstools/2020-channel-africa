Pre-match favourites England needed a last-minute try from Luke-Cowan Dickie to take the contest to sudden death. In a helter-skelter extra-time period, Farrell missed a straightforward penalty shot to win the game. But the captain stepped up once more to nail a kick from a tricky angle to clinch the title. England's players raced over to mob their skipper as the ball split the posts to finally put an extraordinary, see-sawing contest to rest. One-track England still have winning tune in imperfect tournament for imperfect year
'England must embrace being favourites', says Jones
The bookmakers had predicted a 17-point winning margin before kick-off. Alex Corbisiero and Abbie Brown, England players past and present, forecast even more emphatic victories when interviewed by the stadium announcer before the start. Instead the 2,000 fans, back at Twickenham for the first time since March, were treated to a cliff-hanger ending quite out of keeping with the rest of the Autumn Nations Cup. It nearly veered wildly off script to deliver a win for a France side deprived off more than 20 first-choice stars by an availability agreement with their top clubs. Louis Carbonel, the young fly-half who steered France's junior side to an Under-20 World Championship final victory over England in 2018, saw a kick creep over to leave the hosts needing a converted try to force extra-time with four minutes to go.
