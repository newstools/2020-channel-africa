The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, said two humanitarian assessment missions were able to enter the region on Monday. But she said due to restrictions it had not yet been possible to investigate allegations of artillery strikes on populated areas, extrajudicial killings and widespread looting. The UN said it had received consistent reports of artillery strikes in November on homes and a hospital in the town of Humera on the border with Eritrea.
