The TPB union with TIB Corporate Ltd, the commercial banking arm of the TIB Investment Group, is the fourth involving major Tanzanian banking institutions in the past two years, and places TPB Bank, formerly known as Tanzania Postal Bank, among the country's top 10 financial institutions in terms of assets. TPB Bank’s assets base grew by 48 % to $435.65 million after Treasury Registrar Athumani Mbuttuka announced its acquisition of all of TIB’s assets and liabilities with effect from June 1, 2020. In May 2018, TPB Bank took over the former Twiga Bancorp and, three months later it did the same with the Tanzania Women’s Bank (TWB). Both, like TIB Corporate, were government-owned entities experiencing undercapitalisation issues. Twiga and TWB had been put under statutory management of the Bank of Tanzania in 2016. According to Mbuttuka, the TPB Bank-TIB Corporate merger marks another step towards establishing a single state-owned commercial bank to compete with an increasing number of private banks. He said the objective was to continue to improve the operational efficiency of banks currently owned by the bank to begin with. “The merger aims to bring about major reforms in operations, systems and structure so TPB Bank can become formidable competitors in the financial industry,” Mbuttuka added. The TPB Bank-TIB Corporate deal brings the total of registered commercial banks in Tanzania down to 37, excluding six community banks, two development banks, and five micro-finance banks. Top Tanzanian commercial banks now in terms of capitalisation are CRDB, NMB (National Microfinance Bank), National Bank of Commerce (NBC), Stanbic (Tanzania), Standard Chartered, TPB Bank, Diamond Trust, Exim Bank, Azania Bank and Citibank (Tanzania). Also in August 2018, Azania Bank’s acquisition of Bank M allowed it to become Tanzania's leading mortgage lender with a 22% market share which put it ahead of Stanbic Bank, CRDB and Azania Bank. --TheEastAfrican--
