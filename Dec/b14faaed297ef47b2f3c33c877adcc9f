Internet users condemned the 21-year-old midfielderâ€™s decision to travel to Israel, calling it an act of "treachery". Algeria has no diplomatic relations with Israel. The two teams are due to play shortly, but the game is of no importance as both were eliminated in the group stage. A hashtag reading "Boudaoui does not represent Algeria" has been widely used by angry fans, with some demanding that he be axed from the national team. Some users have however called fans to be less harsh with the young player who, they say, "has to fulfil the contract he has with his team". Algerian teams and athletes generally refuse to face Israeli counterparts in international competitions as the two countries do not have diplomatic relationships and in solidarity with Palestinian people under Israeli occupation. Former Algeria players Ishak Belfodil and Safir Taider had played in Israel but they both have dual nationality and used their French passport to enter Israel. Boudaoui was born in Algeria and does not have dual nationality. --BBC--
