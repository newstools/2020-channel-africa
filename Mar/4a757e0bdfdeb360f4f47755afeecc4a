However, according to Spanish media outlet Sport, the 21-year-old has a staggering  $552m  release clause. The Uruguayan born joined Los Blancos in 2016 as an 18-year-old after spending much of his youth career at Penarol in his home town of Montevideo – also the birthplace of former United star Diego Forlan. It has been previously reported that Red Devils along with a host of other top clubs around the world were keen to lure the then-teenager to the United Kingdom but the South American opted to choose Madrid. Described as a box-to-box midfielder, the player has already been likened to Steven Gerrard, the former Liverpool captain. With Tony Kroos and Luka Modric in their 30s, he could be a long-term replacement for the duo. United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has been overhauling the Red Devils squad with numerous additions as well as players who have been sold and sent out on loan deals. Next season, the Solskjaer will be hoping United are among the mix for title credentials as 20-times league champions attempt to keep up with rivals Manchester City and Liverpool in the Premier League. --NEWS24--
