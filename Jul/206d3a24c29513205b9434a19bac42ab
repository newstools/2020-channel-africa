The June 5 Movement, Rally of Patriotic Forces (M5-RFP) said a promise by Keita to reform the constitutional court and an earlier offer to form a coalition government that includes opposition politicians were not enough. Star singer Salif Keita has asked Malians to join the protests that are led by the prominent Muslim cleric, Mahmoud Dicko. In a speech to the nation late on Wednesday, Keita offered to appoint new judges to the constitutional court, which has been at the centre of controversy following the contested March 2020 legislative elections. The M5-RFP movement has been demanding the dissolution of parliament, the formation of a transitional government and the replacement of judges at the constitutional court. Protesters in June 2020 demanded the resignation of Keita for failing to end an Islamist insurgency in central and northern Mali. The protests threaten to further destabilise Mali, which is supported by thousands of foreign forces in its efforts to end jihadist violence. --BBC--
