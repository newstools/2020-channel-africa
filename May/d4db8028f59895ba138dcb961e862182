The Pro Athlete All-Star Ride, the latest bid to attract sports viewers with events shut down during the coronavirus pandemic, will feature a 20-minute men's and equally long women's stationary bicycle ride among athletes who are also Peloton members. Each race will feature eight riders and the one with the highest output number, a combination of cadence and resistance, in each race will be declared the winner. NBA players conducting a shooting contest from their backyards for television and prime-time shows of mini-golf, obstacle course and tag competitions are among the other unique television lures attempted for sport-hungry viewers. The move comes two days after golf stars Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson combined with NFL Super Bowl champion quarterbacks Tom Brady and Peyton Manning to produce a Sunday ratings blockbuster for an 18-hole golf event, the 5.8 million viewers being United States (US) cable's largest-ever golf audience. Top-ranked golfer, McIlroy, set to resume the US PGA Tour season in two weeks at Colonial, drew 2.35 million US viewers for a charity Skins Game with three other tour players the weekend before. --News24--
