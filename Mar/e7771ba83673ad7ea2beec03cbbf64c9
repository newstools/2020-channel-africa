The residents of Langas estate in Eldoret town said they needed to work longer to be able to fend for their families. They stood outside their houses past 7pm local time (16:00GMT), when the curfew starts, chanting that they would not retreat to their homes. Police dispersed them with tear gas and warned offenders of arrest. Residents who spoke to local media said they earn a living as hawkers and that business peaks in the evening when most people are returning home. Kenya imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew last week as a measure to reduce the spread of coronavirus. It has confirmed 42 cases of Covid-19, the respiratory disease caused by coronavirus.
