Dozens of security operatives are barricading the complex. Tensions have been rising in the state ahead of elections for a new governor. Around 200 people have gathered at the parliament, many of whom are supporters of the current Governor, Godwin Obaseki. On Wednesday, the deputy speaker Yekini Idaiye was impeached on charges of gross misconduct. He had previously announced his support for Obaseki's opponent. Supporters of Obaseki say they're concerned that the deputy speaker will use his supporters to take over parliament. A police spokesperson said the officers were at the House of Assembly to prevent a possible breakdown of law and order. --BBC--
