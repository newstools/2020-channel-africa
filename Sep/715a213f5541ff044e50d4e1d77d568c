Meetings called to negotiate a collective trade agreement between the EAC and the United Kingdom have failed to make any substantive progress, leaving Kenya the most exposed to losing its $393 million exports market owing to its classification as a Lower Middle Income Country. With Britain having already exited (Brexit) the European Union early this year, the EAC has until December 31, to negotiate a deal that guarantees all member countries tariff and quota free access to the UK market, similar to the current agreement with the EU. All the other EAC member countries, however, have a window to continue accessing the UK market beyond this deadline except Kenya, which as a Lower Middle Income Country could see its goods subjected to a raft of tariffs and export quotas. “EAC member countries have not yet agreed on a new trade arrangement with the UK,” said Marie Angelique Umulisa, the EAC Principal Trade Officer. Kenya’s exports and imports from the UK hit $742 million last year, compared with $91 million for Uganda and Tanzania’s $231 million. Following the stalemate, the regional Sectoral Council of Ministers of Trade, Industry, Investment and Finance has directed the EAC Secretariat to prepare proposals to the UK by September 18, 2020, for a transitional mechanism and extend the timelines for negotiations of an EAC-UK trade agreement by one year. The Council, through an emergency meeting convened on September 11 to review regional integration programmes including reaching a common position on trade agreements with third party countries, also directed the EAC Permanent Secretaries to engage the British on the proposal for a transitional mechanism to allow Kenya, as a non-Less Developed Country (LDC), to access the UK market on preferential terms after December 31. Tanzania this year officially joined the ranks of Lower Middle Income Countries, but it is still in a transition period in trade terms, during which its trade agreements with other countries remain unaffected.  --TheEastAfrican--
