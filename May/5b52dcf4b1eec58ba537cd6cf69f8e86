Miya is currently on the books of Turkish Super Lig club Konyaspor who he joined from HNK Gorica in August 2019. The 22-year-old has scored five goals in 19 league appearances this season for the club. Salzburg reportedly expressed interest in signing the Cranes forward before his move from Vipers SC to Standard Liege in 2016, but failed to land his services. The Austrian champions boast a healthy African core with the likes of Patson Daka, Enock Mwepu and Sékou Koïta on their books. Miya has scored 19 goals in 58 national team appearances since his debut in 2014.  --AllAfrica--
