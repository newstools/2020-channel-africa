The local currency, which opened the day at R15.21 to the greenback, weakened to a low of R15.34 before strengthening to R15.10 to the dollar, up 0.7% on the day. TreasuryONE, in a snap note, said this was due to the Budget largely being in line with market expectations. The Finance Minister announced no major tax increases, and, despite some speculation, the VAT rate was not hiked. Treasury outlined a future proposal to bring down South Africa's (SA) company tax rate of 28% to make SA more competitive, as well as measures to provide income tax relief to individual taxpayers. "Given the worsening economic realities still facing the Minister of Finance this year, it came as a pleasant surprise that he provided 5.2%  adjustments to the individual tax brackets and rebates," said PwC Associate Director Barry Knoetze in a statement. Mboweni also announced an ambitious three-year proposal to cut the state's wage bill by some $11 billion (R160 billion).
