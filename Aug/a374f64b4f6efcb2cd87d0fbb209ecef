Seven of the suspects left in July when reports about the rape started circulating online. This was a month before the rape victim filed an official complaint. The public prosecutor said the country was taking international measures to pursue the seven suspects. Two other suspects are at large and the prosecutors are seeking to arrest them. The alleged gang rape happened at Cairoâ€™s Fairmont Nile City hotel in 2014 where the nine men are suspected to have drugged and rapped a young woman. The incident was exposed online by an Instagram account that has been outing rapists. The prosecutor urged rape victims to first make official complaints before circulating reports online. --BBC--
