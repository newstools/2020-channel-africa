European shares recorded their worst one-day loss since June 2016 on Monday as worries about the spread of the new virus far beyond China whacked global markets and risk sentiment. On Tuesday, the pan-European STOXX 600 index initially rose 0.6% in London but was down 0.3% by early afternoon. Italian shares lost 0.3%, adding to their earlier losses. Italy is grappling with the worst outbreak of coronavirus in Europe. More than 80 000 people have been infected in China since the outbreak began, apparently in an illegal wildlife market in the central city of Wuhan late in 2019. Chinaâ€™s death toll was 2,663 by the end of Monday, up 71 from the previous day. But the World Health Organization (WHO) has said the epidemic in China peaked between Janaury 23 and February 2 and has been declining since.
