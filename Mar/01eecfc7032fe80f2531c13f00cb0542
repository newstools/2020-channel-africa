In his address, Ramaphosa ordered that "companies whose operations require continuous processes such as furnaces or underground mine operations will be required to make arrangements for care and maintenance to avoid damage to their continuous operations". Large and small cap mining companies have indicted that they would halt operations in what is expected to severely impact the key sector, which has already been suffering as a result of commodity price volatility and a range of domestic operational challenges.Â 

Over the past few years, the local mining sector has been shedding jobs as companies close down loss-making shafts to improve capacity. Production of some key minerals, such as gold, has also plunged. AngloGold Ashanti announced on Tuesday that it will "temporarily suspend production from its South African operations for three weeks as of midnight on 26 March 2020." Its operations would be placed into care and maintenance over the period.
