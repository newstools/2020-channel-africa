The company announced a plan last month to cut the number of models it makes globally and improve efficiency after the pandemic triggered its first annual loss in 11 years. Nissan will expand its SUV and cross-over portfolio in Africa with seven new models, of which four will be in the SUV (sports utility vehicle) category, Shinkichi Izumi, Managing Director at Nissan South Africa, said. It plans to make Africa a hub for light commercial vehicles (LCV), will increase production of its popular Navara pick-ups and open plants in Ghana and Kenya, Izumi said. He did not disclose details of the investment and levels of production for the region, although Nissan said last year it would spend R3 billion ($174.07 million) on its Navara model. “We are going to locally produce the new Navara model and we are also looking at export,” Guillaume Cartier, Chairperson for Nissan’s Africa, Middle East, and India (AMI) region, told a media call.
