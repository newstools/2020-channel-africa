The Madrid Open is one of more than 30 tournaments cancelled so far due to the coronavirus outbreak, and has decided to hold a virtual version instead. Andy Murray and Benoit Paire were among those to commit early, and they have now been joined by more of tennis' star names. Rafael Nadal, David Goffin, John Isner, Karen Khachanov, Eugenie Bouchard, Kristina Mladenovic, and Kiki Bertens are also now set to take part in the competition from home. "This initiative is interesting and it will bring back some competition in our sport," Khachanov said. "I am looking forward to challenge my fellow players and show my skills to the tennis fans around the world." --News24--
