The country started testing all long-distance drivers two weeks ago. They are then allowed to continue their journeys, and are tracked down if found to be positive for Covid-19. Initially, Uganda had not included these confirmed cases in its official data, as it intended to deport the drivers. But the ministry of health has released a statement clarifying that World Health Organization(WHO) regulations require that every case is counted and treated in the country where the patient has been tested. Between 700 and 1,000 cross-border cargo drivers are tested every day, according to the ministry. Uganda has carried out over 14,700 tests, and has not recorded any deaths due to Covid-19. The country is currently in the middle of a 21-day lockdown and curfew.
