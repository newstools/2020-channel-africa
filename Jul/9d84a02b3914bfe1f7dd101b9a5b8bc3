Instead, the Director of Cricket at St David's Proteas star, Temba Bavuma's alma mater is trying to guide numerous 18-year-old cricketers anxious about their future plans being dumped into turmoil by the Covid-19 pandemic. "It's been very sad to see 2020's school sporting calendar simply evaporate," Nosworthy, whose stellar coaching career includes South Africa 'A', New Zealand 'A', Canterbury, various franchise gigs and director of cricket at Somerset, told Sport24. "There are so many matrics around the country, who had planned to use their talent to attempt and launch a good sporting career. But they'll have no matches to use as a platform. As things stand, school sports simply won't happen." Junior cricket will indeed be a write in 2020, with Cricket South Africa (CSA) on the verge of officially cancelling all their youth weeks, including the Khaya Majola Under-19 week. "To all intents and purposes, those events aren't going to happen," Niels Momberg, CSA's General Manager for Youth Cricket, told Sport24. "We've been liaising with the Department of Basic Education and the message has been pretty clear. No extramural activities are allowed, not only as a safety measure, but also simply because there's no time for it. At the moment, completing the academic calendar is the top priority." That's not the type of thing Nosworthy, whose company, Cricket Mentor, provides counselling and career guidance to juniors and professionals, wants to hear. "What you have now is the real danger of whole year group of players getting lost in the system," he said. "The important thing to remember about the youth weeks is that it provides context. It's not just young players representing their schools. These boys aim to represent their provinces because that's where the real exposure lies. --News24--
