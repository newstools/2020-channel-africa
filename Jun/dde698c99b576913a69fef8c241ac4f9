The oil giant had paused redundancies during the peak of the pandemic but told staff on Monday that around 15% will leave by the end of the year. BP has not said how many jobs will be lost in the United Kingdom (UK) but it is thought the figure could be close to 2 000. Chief Executive, Bernard Looney, blamed a drop in the oil price for the cuts. In an email to staff, he said: "The oil price has plunged well below the level we need to turn a profit. "We are spending much, much more than we make, I am talking millions of dollars, every day." Countries across the globe have ordered people to stay indoors and not travel, which has caused a slump in demand for oil. As a result, the cost of oil fell to less than $20 a barrel at the peak of the crisis, less than a third of the $66 it cost at the start of the year. It has since partly recovered to around $42 a barrel. That has taken a toll on the industry, sparking warnings that 30Â 000 UK jobs could be lost as a result of the crisis. BP employs around 15 000 people in the UK. The firm's office-based workers are expected to bear the brunt of the redundancies, which will not affect any of its retail staff. "It was always part of the plan to make BP a leaner, faster-moving and lower carbon company," Looney, who took over as the boss of BP in February said in his email to staff on Monday. --BBC--
