Mgoduso’s resignation comes a day before Finance Minister Tito Mboweni tables the Medium Term Budget Policy Statement in parliament. SAA business rescue practitioners have long been waiting for the government to avail more than $62 million in funding to restructure the embattled airline. Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan has thanked Mgoduso for her contribution to steering SAA towards a more sustainable future. Magoduso also served as a non-executive director at a state-owned airline. In an earlier statement, SAA announced that a new interim board, as well as a new executive team, will be announced as part of an effort to create a restructured SAA. It is expected that Finance Minister Tito Mboweni will allocate funding for the embattled national carrier to resume its restructuring process when he addresses parliament on Wednesday.
