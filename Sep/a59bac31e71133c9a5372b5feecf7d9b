Regional economic experts affirmed this position during a recent African Development Bank (AfDB) webinar for Asian audiences, which also noted that the policy recommendations of the African Economic Outlook Supplement could be regarded as important opportunity for investments. In an outcome statement shared with the media after the engagement, AfDB said participants endorsed the supplement report, which revised the growth projections and outlook for Africa for 2020 and 2021 and highlights the impact of Covid-19 on the continent’s socio-economic landscape. The report recommends policy responses to safely re-open economies and accelerate growth recovery. “Despite the Covid-19 pandemic, investment opportunities still abound in Africa,” said Tetsushi Sonobe, the Dean of the Asian Development Bank Institute (ADBI). “Global markets are shifting to South Asia and Africa. “In a sense, Africa is not very far for Asian investors who might be interested in the investment opportunities on the continent.” Khaled Sherif, the AfDB’s vice president for regional development, integration and business delivery said despite the pandemic affecting all African economies, its magnitude will vary considerably from country to country, depending on the economic characteristics and initial conditions of the countries. “This urges us to avoid the one-size-fits-all solution to address the effects of Covid-19 in Africa. For that, the AEO Supplement notes that the continent will need the support and expertise of all,” he said. “This is an opportunity to enrich the debate on what appropriate measures are needed to support African countries to recover from the pandemic, drawing particularly from Asian experience.” Sonobe observed that Africa’s Gross Domestic Product growth was projected to quickly rebound in 2021 following steady growth before Covid-19 and identified some of the potential opportunities highlighted in the outlook supplement.  --Herald--
