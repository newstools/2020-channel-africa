The UN mission in Libya said it was very concerned by the discovery of at least eight mass graves, most of them in the city of Tarhouna. The mission said last week it had received numerous reports of looting and the destruction of private and public property in the region, which in some cases appeared to be acts of retribution. --BBC--
