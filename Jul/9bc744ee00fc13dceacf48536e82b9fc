Vettel is searching for another team for the 2021 season after making it was clear he would like to continue in Formula 1 once his Ferrari contract expires at the end of the 2020 campaign. The four-time World Champion is seeing the best of his options disappear, though, with Mercedes ready to commit Lewis Hamilton and Valtteri Bottas to new contracts and Renault announcing the return of Fernando Alonso for a third spell with the team starting in 2021. Speculation over Vettel making a return of his own, to Red Bull, re-emerged after a report by Motorsport-Total.com claimed that Red Bull owner Dietrich Mateschitz had instructed Marko to set the wheels in motion about bringing the four-time World Champion back to partner Max Verstappen. In a separate, subsequent report by fellow German outlet Auto Motor und Sport, Marko is quoted as saying that there are still no plans to re-sign Vettel. --News24--
