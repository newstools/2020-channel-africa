It had been reported that the United Arab Emirates - which staged the Indian Premier League from September to November - could have hosted the tour because of coronavirus concerns in India. Jay Shah, honorary secretary of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), said it would "leave no stone unturned to make sure that the tour is held adhering to all safety protocols". England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) Chief Executive Tom Harrison said: "The prospect of becoming the first international side to play at the magnificent Sardar Patel Stadium in Ahmedabad adds an extra dimension to the tour and I know will be something that is a highlight for both the players and management." England's tour of South Africa was abandoned on Monday without the ODIs being played after a number of positive coronavirus tests. On Wednesday England confirmed they will play two Tests in Sri Lanka from January 14-26. They will fly straight to India after that tour. The England series will be India's first at home since the start of the pandemic. They are currently in Australia, where they will begin a four-Test series on December 17. --BBC--
