Tripoli Central Hospital was hit on Thursday morning, while 14 civilians were wounded in similar attacks in residential areas of the capital city. The hospital in Tripoli is one of the city’s largest and is key to the country’s response to coronavirus. “Attacks on hospitals in Libya are becoming far too frequent. Although thankfully no-one was hurt today, Tripoli Central Hospital has 5000 staff and 950 beds, so thousands of lives were at risk," said IRC Libya boss Tom Garofalo. Libya has been wracked by conflict since the 2011 uprising, which ousted long-time late leader Muammar Gaddafi. --BBC--
