That’s if the current President, Ahmad Ahmad, decides not to pursue another term having been elected in 2017 replacing experienced Cameroonian football administrator, Issa Hayatou. Abo Rida, who is already part of the CAF Executive Committee, indicated that he respects Magalasy football administrator Ahmad. “The CAF now has a President and he has all respect, so we have spoken carefully about the elections,” Abo Rida said. “I will run for the CAF presidential election if Ahmad decides not to go for it.” Abo Rida served as the EFA President between 2016 and 2019, but he resigned following the shock elimination of Egypt from the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) Round 16. “I hope to gain the support of the Egyptian country during the CAF presidential election,” the 66-year-old football administrator added. The CAF elections are scheduled to be held in March 2021 and it remains to be seen whether Ahmad will pursue another term. Abo Rida is also an International Federation of Association Football council member since 2017. --AfricaNews--
