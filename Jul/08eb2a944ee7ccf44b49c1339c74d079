Pictures on national television show the funeral procession at a stadium in the singer's hometown of Ambo, about 100km west of the capital, Addis Ababa. An attempt to prevent Hachalu's body from reaching Ambo from the capital, where he was shot dead, led to the arrest of 35 people including the prominent politician Jawar Mohammed. Trouble has continued since the killing by unknown gunmen, with explosions being heard in Addis Ababa.
