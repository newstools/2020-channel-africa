The donation came after a promise made during a phone conversation between President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed in April. The US Ambassador Michael Raynor said the donation "reinforces its unwavering commitment to the Ethiopian people". "This donation is a critical addition to the billions of dollars in resources and expertise that the American people have invested in Ethiopia’s health system in recent years. I am honoured to join Minister Dr Lia Tadesse to hand over this new equipment and to continue our work together, mitigating the impact of Covid-19 and helping Ethiopia save lives," said Raynor at the handover event. Ethiopian Health minister Dr Tadesse thanked the US for the donation. "Ethiopia appreciates President Donald Trump’s generous contribution, and that of the American people to our citizens. The United States and Ethiopia share a long history of cooperation, and the support of the United States Government over the years has helped strengthen and enhance the Ethiopian health system," she said. The US in a statement said it would provide warranty and service plans, and training for Ethiopian medical professionals. --BBC--
