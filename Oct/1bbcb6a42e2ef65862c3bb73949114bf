"I do not believe that the prime minister wants to set off on a national lockdown, but as ever he is advised by scientists- he takes that decision," Coffey told Sky. Asked if England was heading for a national lockdown in the next two weeks, Coffey said: "I don't believe that is the case but as I say this will continue to be a decision that the prime minister will lead on." Coffey said the three-tier system of lockdowns announced on Monday should be given a chance to work. --Reuters--
