Like thousands of others, he is still in a temporary shelter almost a year to the day after Cyclone Idai tore through southern Africa. He walks with a limp from the injuries he suffered when a wall in his house fell on him during the deluge. He is supposed to get food aid every month, he says, but sometimes the supplies come late. “I don’t have the strength to work but I don’t have a choice. I need to feed myself,” he tells Reuters. Then he goes back to gathering his food, pulling at the maize stalks that tower above his head. Gaspar lives on his own in a United Nations-backed government camp in Nhamatanda district, about 70 kilometres  inland from the port city of Beira where the cyclone hit land on March 2019. The government plan is to build up the camp into a permanent settlement. But for now the residents are making do with huts and tents and the small plots of land they have to grow their own crops. Cyclone Idai, and then Cyclone Kenneth, which hit just six weeks later, destroyed 700 000 hectares of maize, beans, rice and other produce. In February more floods hit Sofala, the central province worst affected by Idai, swamping more fields.
