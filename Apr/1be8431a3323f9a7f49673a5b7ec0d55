The chairperson of the Eurogroup, Mário Centeno, announced the deal, reached after marathon discussions in Brussels. It comes as Spain's Prime Minister said the country was close to passing the worst of its coronavirus outbreak. Spain has Europe's highest number of confirmed cases, with 152 446. More than 15 000 people have died. The head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned the world is facing the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Kristalina Georgieva said the coronavirus pandemic would turn economic growth “sharply negative” this year. At their Brussels talks, EU ministers failed to accept a demand from France and Italy to share out the cost of the crisis by issuing so-called corona bonds. The package finally agreed is smaller than the European Central Bank had urged.  --BBC--
