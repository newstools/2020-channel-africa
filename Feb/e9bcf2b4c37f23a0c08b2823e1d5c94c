Le Clos senior was talking as he made an appearance at the 47 edition of the Midmar Mile in Howick at the weekend, where he was impressed with how the race has grown. He was there as a representative of the Chad le Clos Foundation, which is in partnership with the Midmar Mile, but his son was not present as he is currently preparing for the Tokyo Olympics in Turkey. However, in an interview with The Witness, Le Clos expressed his sadness at how swimmers were not getting the same recognition and respect as soccer, rugby and cricket players in spite of them bringing in more international medals. “Corporate South Africa should get behind these guys; swimmers in this country don’t get the recognition that soccer players get, but they bring more gold medals than soccer and cricket put together,” he said. “You know what rugby players get? Billions. Soccer players get more than millions and cricket players they get telephone numbers, too. “Swimmers get nothing, their parents slave to get their kids into international swimming.”
