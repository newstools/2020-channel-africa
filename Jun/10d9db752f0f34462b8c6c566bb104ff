The Committee on Economic Sustainability Plan, led by Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo, said restrictions imposed to prevent the spread of coronavirus had mainly affected agriculture, manufacturing and tourism sectors. It said the dip in the nation's oil earnings would result in a $473m shortfall every month. The committee presented its economic plan to President Muhammadu Buhari on Thursday. Among its recommendations is the rolling out of mass programmes that create jobs and and utilise local materials in agriculture, housing and road construction. Nigeria's Lagos, Abuja and Ogun states were put on lockdown that ended in May to prevent the spread of coronavirus. The country has so far confirmed 14,554 cases of coronavirus. --BBC--
