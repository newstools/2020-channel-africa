Chief Kariuki received global attention in 2014 for using Twitter to fight crime in his area. His tweets would be sent to subscribers, who did not need to have a Twitter account or an internet connection - via free text messages. When residents of his village reported a theft, Chief Kariuki passed the details on to his thousands of followers on Twitter who then helped track stolen property. He told the BBC in 2015 that he believed even thieves follow him on Twitter. "If I send a message out that someone has stolen something they just drop the thing and run," he said. --BBC--
