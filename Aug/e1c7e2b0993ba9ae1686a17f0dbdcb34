The national public holiday of Women's Day chiefly commemorates the 1956 march to the Union Buildings by women protesting against the apartheid government's dompass laws and other forms of legislation such as the Urban Areas Act. Today, Women's Day remembers this occasion whilst bringing sharp focus to current challenges facing South African women today, including gender-based violence, wage inequality and the highest levels of vulnerability to unemployment, poverty and economic exclusion. Ramaphosa wrote that because economic inequality and social inequality were interconnected, the economic status of women in South Africa made them vulnerable to abuse. "We must therefore scale up support for women to enable them to become financially independent," Ramaphosa wrote. Ramaphosa wrote that government's plan for women's economic inclusion would include public procurement, where government set a target of at least 40% of goods and services procured by public entities are sourced from women-owned businesses. "Secondly, we are going to scale up support for women. This will include engagement with the financial sector to make financial services accessible and affordable for women," said Ramaphosa. He said government would work to ensure more women's access to land in governmentâ€™s accelerating land reform programme. --News24--
