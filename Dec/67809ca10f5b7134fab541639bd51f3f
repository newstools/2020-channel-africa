Botswana says it is sending thousands of wild elephants back to neighbouring Angola. The southern African country has the largest number of elephants in the world, an estimated 130,000 of them. But tens of thousands are actually refugees from Angolaâ€™s civil war between 1975 and 2002. They are now expected to repopulate and recolonise their former habitat, in southeast Angola. Botswana opposition MP and conservationist Kgoborego Nkawana told the BBC Newsday programme that elephants have a big home range that includes Zimbabwe, Zambia, Namibia and Angola. "They have always stayed in those areas, but they had to move out of Angola because of the war. Part of the home ranges in Angola have to be demined for them to move... I know Angola has been working with the United Nations to try and demine some of these areas," he said. "What you have to understand is that elephants do remember their past experiences and they will always try to avoid where there is danger..." he added. --BBC--
