Ali Kushayb was speaking at his first appearance at the International Criminal Court (ICC). He was a leader of the Janjaweed, a notorious pro-government militia which carried out atrocities against the civilian population. A warrant for his arrest was issued 13 years ago listing 50 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity, including murder, rape and torture. He surrendered last week in the Central African Republic where he'd been in hiding since February when Sudan announced that it would hand over suspects wanted by the ICC. Sudan's former President, Omar al-Bashir, is also wanted by the court. Some 300 000 people were killed in the conflict in Darfur and around 2.5 million were displaced. --BBC--
