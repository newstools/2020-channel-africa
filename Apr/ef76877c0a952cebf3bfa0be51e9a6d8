Citing a statement from IAA, local news magazine The Independent reported that the decision followed the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) declaration of the disease as a pandemic. "Private hospitals and clinics are not allowed to treat coronavirus cases and will consequently not be covered by your insurance contract,” IAA head of clients Helen Mbabazi said in the statement, adding that there were specialised government designated centres where all confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus were treated. Uganda's health ministry says the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in the country has increased to 44. Globally, more than 800,000 people have been infected with the virus, out of which just over 40,000 have died. In South Africa, medical aid company Discovery Health assured its clients that it would extend healthcare benefits for Covid-19. “The WHO global outbreak benefit is available to all members of Discovery during a declared outbreak period. Once your diagnosis is confirmed, you are covered for out-of-hospital costs for the related treatment from the scheme and not from your day-to-day benefits," Discovery said in a statement posted on its website. "Cover includes a defined basket of care that comprises the diagnostic test, a consultation and defined supportive treatment and medicine." Another South African medical aid company, Bonitas, said its cover for Covid-19 included diagnostic testing according to agreed protocols, consultations with healthcare professionals and defined supportive treatment and medicines. --ANA--
