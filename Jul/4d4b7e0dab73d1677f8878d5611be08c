Gomaa joined Al Ahly in 2015 from ENPPI and enjoyed a fine start to his career with the Red Devils. However, he has fallen out of favour in recent years, due to issues with discipline, lack of form and injuries. The 26-year-old has been linked with a move away from Ahly, with several rumours suggesting that arch rivals Zamalek could be suitors – though Gomaa’s lawyer insists this is not on the table. “I laugh when I hear these rumours. Salah still has two and a half years in his contract with Al Ahly, so how can he sign for Zamalek?” Abdelaziz told MBC Masr TV, as quoted by King Fut. “Saleh is committed to training properly and has the determination and the persistence to become a starter at Al Ahly once again as a playmaker. “I don’t know where these rumours come from, I’m his lawyer so will he sign without me knowing? Saleh Gomaa will stay at Al Ahly.” 

The midfielder has won four Egyptian Premier League titles and will hope to secure a fifth when the 2019-20 season resumes next month. --AfricaFootballNews--
