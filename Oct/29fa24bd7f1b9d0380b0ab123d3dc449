There has also been reports of violence and that police arrested an opposition leader in the semi-autonomous archipelago of Zanzibar. Voters have until 16:00 local time to cast their ballots. President John Magufuli, whose party has governed Tanzania for decades, is seeking a second term in office. His main challenger is expected to be Tundu Lissu of the biggest opposition party, Chadema, who survived an assassination attempt three years ago. He returned from Belgium in July 2020 where he had undergone rounds of treatment for gunshot wounds. In all, 15 candidates are running for President, including former Foreign Minister, Bernard Membe, a former-colleague-turned-critic of Magufuli who defected from the ruling party. Results for the presidential and parliamentary elections are expected to be announced within one week. -BBC--
