Algeria has been importing most of its medical products needs from China since the outbreak of virus, and the government has said it would spend $100 million on purchases of those products. The government has so far reported 3 382 confirmed cases, with 425 deaths and 1 508 recoveries. The authorities on Saturday decided to allow some businesses to reopen, a day after shortening curfew for several provinces including the capital Algiers. --Reuters--
