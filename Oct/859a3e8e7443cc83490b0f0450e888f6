But the 27-year-old added that he will "do everything" to put United "where the club deserves" to be. The France player has regularly been linked with a move away from the team he re-joined for £89 million ($115.2 million) in 2016. The World Cup-winner's contract expires in the summer, although United can activate the option of a further year until 2022. And Pogba said he has not had any discussions with the club over an extension. "No-one has told me anything," he said at a press conference with the France national team on Thursday. "I have not spoken to (United executive vice-chairperson) Ed Woodward. We haven't spoken about a new deal.” "At the moment, I am in Manchester and I am concentrating about getting back to my best form. I think there will be a moment when the club will come and talk to me and maybe offer me something or not." he added. Asked about the prospect of a move to Madrid, with whom he has been linked on a number of occasions, he replied: "All football players would love to play for Real Madrid. It is a dream for me, why not one day?” "I am in Manchester and I love my club. I am playing in Manchester, I'm having fun and I want to do everything to put the club where it deserves. I will give everything to the max, like my team-mates." United have had a troubled start to the season, winning just one of their opening three league games. Their last game before the international break saw them hammered 6-1 at home by Tottenham to leave them 16th in the Premier League table. Pogba has started all three of United's league games this campaign, having self-isolated after testing positive for coronavirus in August. --BBC--
