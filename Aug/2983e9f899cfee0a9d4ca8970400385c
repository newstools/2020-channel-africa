The move comes as the two sides wrestle to put to an end their 16-year trade battle over state aid for Airbus and American rival, Boeing. The US in 2019 raised border taxes on more than 100 items, including jumpers, single-malt whiskies and cheese. It has said the European Union (EU) has not done enough. "The EU and member states have not taken the actions necessary to come into compliance with World Trade Organisation decisions," America's top trade official, Robert Lighthizer, said on Wednesday. "The US, however, is committed to obtaining a long-term resolution to this dispute. The EU cautiously welcomed the US decision not to increase the amount of goods subject to tariffs. "The Commission acknowledges the decision of the US not to exacerbate the on-going aircraft dispute by increasing tariffs on European products," an EU spokesperson said. Airbus last month said it would alter some deals responsible for the dispute, saying the changes, including increasing its interest rates on loans with France and Spain, eliminated "any justification" for the US border taxes. The move prompted EU officials to call for an end to "unjustified" tariffs. Many American businesses have also protested the duties, which raise prices for American buyers. --BBC--
