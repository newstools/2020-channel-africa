Leeds were on the brink of ending a 16-year wait to return to the lucrative Premier League before football was suspended across England until at least April 30 due to the coronavirus pandemic. The club said the lack of income would cost "several million pounds each month". "Leeds United can confirm that the players, coaching staff and senior management team have volunteered to take a wage deferral for the foreseeable future to ensure that all non-football staff at Elland Road and Thorp Arch (training ground) can be paid and the integrity of the business can be maintained during these uncertain times," Leeds said in a statement. "It is important that we all work together to find a way that the club can push through this period and end the season in the way we all hope we can," the statement added.
