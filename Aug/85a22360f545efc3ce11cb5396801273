The company fired Easterbrook last year after finding he had a consensual relationship with an employee. But the firm says further investigation found the British executive had three additional relationships with staff, about which he lied to the board. McDonald's is suing to recover his pay-off, reportedly worth $40 million. The fast food giant prohibits "any kind of intimate relationship between employees in a direct or indirect reporting relationship". At the time of Easterbrook's removal in November 2019, McDonald's said it had evidence of only of a non-physical, consensual relationship, consisting of intimate text messages and video calls. It agreed to terminate Easterbrook's contract "without cause", fearing a protracted legal battle, according to the firm's legal filing. But after receiving a tip from an employee in July 2019, the fast food giant started a second investigation, which uncovered "undisputable evidence" of three other sexual relationships. --BBC--
