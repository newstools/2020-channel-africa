Play was delayed by three hours after the air quality was rated "unhealthy". Matches began at 13:00 local time (02:00 GMT) but were later suspended for the day because of heavy rain. On Tuesday, Slovenia's Dalila Jakupovic had to be helped off court after retiring from her match. Air quality in the city was rated as moderate by late afternoon. Harriet Dart was the only Briton to win on the opening day of qualifying on Tuesday but her second-round match against Nicole Gibbs has been pushed back to Thursday. "It was a little bit different, especially with the visual appearance of everything," Dart told BBC Radio 5 Live. "I didn't go outside too much until my match. I think I was quite lucky to be playing later as the conditions definitely improved as the day went on." At least 28 people have died and an estimated 10 million hectares (100,000 sq km) of land in Australia has burned since July 1. The Rally for Relief exhibition match, featuring Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Serena Williams, with all money raised being donated to the bushfire relief fund, is scheduled to take place at Rod Laver Arena on Wednesday night. --BBC--
