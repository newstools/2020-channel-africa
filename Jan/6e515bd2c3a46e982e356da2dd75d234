The 15 were released to their families "on the condition that they would bring them back when they are needed for the investigation", said Shehu Tasi’u, a senior official of the police force known as Hisbah. The 15 were arrested on Thursday after Hisbah received a tip-off that they were attending a party that was "unlawful", Shehu Tasi’u told BBC Hausa. Asked to clarify whether they were arrested for being crossdressers or homosexuals, he said: "No, they’re both the same, they were called crossdressers because of their dressing, and gays for what they do sexually." Islamic law is enforced in most Muslim-majority states in northern Nigeria, alongside secular law. Homosexual acts are illegal in both legal systems. Nigeria is a deeply religious society, where most people uphold conservative social values. --BBC--
