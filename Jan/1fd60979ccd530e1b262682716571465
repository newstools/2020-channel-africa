Since last month migrants had been demonstrating in front of the offices of the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) calling for their paperwork to be processed and asking to be transferred to countries in Europe. Over the weekend the police moved in and violently dispersed the protest. The local authorities said some migrants then torched around 300 prefabricated homes. The Sudanese asylum seekers started arriving in Niger two years ago after fleeing dangerous conditions in Libya. They accuse the UNHCR of neglecting them. --BBC--
