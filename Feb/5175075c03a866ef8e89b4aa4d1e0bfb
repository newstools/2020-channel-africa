Canada's Taylor claimed his second tour title more than five years after he won the Sanderson Farms Championship as a rookie in November 2014. Leading Mickelson by one to start the day, he built his lead to five strokes at the turn only to see it dwindle to two through 14 as players battled in rapidly falling temperatures and gusting winds. A chip-in birdie at the par-four 15th pushed Taylor's lead back to three and he added another birdie at the par-three 17th to finish with a 19-under par total of 268. American Kevin Streelman was second after a 68 for 272 as Mickelson - who started the day one shot behind Taylor - settled for a two-over par 74 and solo third on 273."That was amazing," Taylor said. "An up and down day. I believed I could do it because I've done it before, but to do it in that fashion, playing with Phil, obviously gives me a lot of confidence going forward. Taylor and Mickelson, playing together in the last group, quickly found themselves duelling as they left the field behind early. Taylor got going with back-to-back birdies at the fourth and fifth, then holed out from a greenside bunker for an eagle at the sixth to stretch his lead to two even as Mickelson birdied the par-five sixth. Taylor kept it rolling with a testing 12-footer to save par at the seventh, the picturesque par-three where his tee shot came up short in the front bunker. The 31-year-old from Winnipeg was unable to get up and down from a greenside bunker at the eighth, but still stretched his lead over Mickelson to three as the American made a double-bogey.
