At least 12 people are reported to have been injured in the eastern city of Kankan, where protesters clashed with supporters of President Alpha Cond√©. In the capital, Conakry, many demonstrators were dressed in red in support of the opposition. Protests have been taking place in Guinea since October over concerns that Conde, who is 81 years old, plans to reform the constitution to stay in office for a third term. --BBC--
