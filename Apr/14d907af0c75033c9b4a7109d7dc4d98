St Nicholas Hospital said in a statement that it would stop offering services for two weeks. The hospital's clinical director said the premises would be disinfected and closed during the period as recommended by government agencies. Patients have been urged to consult the hospital's doctors remotely by calling in. Local media outlets are reporting that five other private hospitals in Lagos have also closed because of exposure to the virus. Lagos state has 376 cases out of the 665 cases reported in Nigeria. Last week, a doctor based in Lagos died after getting exposed to the virus at his private hospital. --BBC--
