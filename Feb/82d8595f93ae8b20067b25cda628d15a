The Movement says they want clarity on charges to residents, businesses and government buildings. This as the movement begins protesting in parts of Gauteng to raise concerns over their fight with Eskom. The demonstrations were sparked after the cash strapped power utility cut power supply to Soweto customers in arrears – in an effort to recoup the R18-billion electricity bill owed to Eskom.

Electricity Crisis Movement spokesperson, Rufus Tsoka, says pockets of protestors are emerging in areas including Alexandra, Eldorado Park and Thembisa.
