The proposal passed with the support of more than 99% of shares voted. The results were released during shareholder meetings streamed online due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Investors in Dutch-listed Unilever NV UNA.AS approved the move with 99.4% support last month. Unilever wants to unify on November 29, ending a hybrid structure that dates back to the merger of British soap maker Lever Brothers and Margarine Unie in the Netherlands. The maker of Dove soap, Hellmann’s mayonnaise and Ben & Jerry’s ice cream says the dual structure hampers its ability to conduct acquisitions and asset sales quickly, such as the planned sale of its tea business. Such flexibility is key to Unilever’s ambition to shift its portfolio into higher-growth areas like premium beauty. Unilever has said this will become even more important as a result of the pandemic. The final steps towards completing the unification include UK High Court hearings on October 23 and November 2, with the Dutch-listed shares ceasing trading after November 27. The only potential worry for Unilever is an “exit tax” proposed by a Dutch opposition party that could cost the company up to $13 billion.
