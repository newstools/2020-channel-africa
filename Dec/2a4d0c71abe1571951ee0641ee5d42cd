On Saturday armed men on motorcycles led a brutal attack on farmers harvesting in rice fields. At least 43 bodies of the victims were recovered and buried on Sunday. In the video seen by the BBC, Abubakar Shekau, the leader of a Boko Haram faction - who masked his face - said that the group carried out the attack on the farmers at the weekend. This is coming amid growing outrage across Nigeria over the killings, described as the worst in recent months. In a rowdy session on Tuesday, members of parliament invited President Muhammadu Buhari to brief the lawmakers on the security situation in the country. Senators also demanded that the countryâ€™s security chiefs lose their jobs. This is the third time the Nigerian senate will ask the president to sack the heads of the military. The lawmakers have also asked the president to immediately initiate an investigation into widespread allegations of corruption and leakages within the Nigeria security structure. They called for the recruitment of 10,000 local vigilantes to complement the efforts of the armed forces in fighting the insurgents. --BBC--
