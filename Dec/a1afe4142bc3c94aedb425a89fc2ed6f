The National Inspectorate of Economic Activities spokesperson, Tom√°s Timba, said the schools had failed in cleanliness, lacked thermometers and students were not learning in shifts as required. Some 216 commercial establishments were also inspected and 17 of them found to be non-compliant. Some restaurants and bars were found to have more than the required number of customers some opened outside the recommended time and others lacked hygiene. The inspectorate will continue with inspections especially during the December holidays to ensure compliance and prevent the spread of coronavirus. --BBC--
