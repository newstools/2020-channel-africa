This was announced by PSL Chairperson, Irvin Khoza in Parktown, Johannesburg, on Monday. The announcement follows a decision by President Cyril Ramaphosa on Sunday night that all gatherings of more than 100 people are now prohibited due to the rapid spread of the coronavirus. The games tomorrow and Wednesday are all suspended. All games over this coming weekend are also suspended. Khoza says there will be an urgent meeting of the executive committee and the board of governors on Thursday the 19. “The league also took a decision that the Diski challenge on its own which is a separate thing is discontinued immediately but the issues that affect the leave itself will be canvassed with the board of governors on Thursday,” says Khoza. A meeting on Thursday will take place to discuss further implementations.

Many sporting federations around the world have put on hold fixtures with the hope that they’ll be able to resume in April. Two high profile PSL matches are immediately affected. Mamelodi Sundowns and Orlando Pirates are supposed to clash at Loftus Versveld on Tuesday evening, while Chiefs are down to host Bidvest Wits on Wednesday. --SABC--
