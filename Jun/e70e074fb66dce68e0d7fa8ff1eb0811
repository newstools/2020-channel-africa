Among the accusations in the report, which it released on Friday, was that 39 people were shot dead by security forces in Oromia regional state in 2019. Attorney General Adanech Abiebie declined to issue a specific response to the report, instead saying that the authorities still need to look into its veracity. ''Now, we are working on finalising our investigation and checking the content and process of the report for actuality and neutrality. ''After the investigation is complete, where the report is correct, we will take the necessary steps to remedy the problem and where the report is false or exaggerated, we shall discuss with Amnesty International and let the report be corrected accordingly,'' the official said. â€œIf correction proves impossible, we shall present the truth with its respective proof so that our people, and the world, are aware.'' The report also highlighted the alleged role of security forces in inter-communal violence in Amhara state, north-west Ethiopia, where it says local militia and vigilantes joined forces to kill at least 100 people. Over the weekend, the federal government described the accusation of extrajudicial killings as "lies... purposefully disseminated by forces that seek to actively undermine initiatives of dialogue, peace and stability on the area". The regional governments in Oromia and Amhara also described the report as "one-sided". --BBC--
