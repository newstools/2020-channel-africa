He added that Special Forces from the Amhara region had joined federal troops in fighting Tigray government forces. The clashes were taking place near Tigray's border with Amhara, Debretsion said. Tigray forces had seized “almost all” the weaponry from the Ethiopian military's Northern Command, he said. “The people of Tigray shouldn’t be attacked with the weapons in Tigray. We are fully armed now. We are not inferior to them in terms of weaponry, maybe better,” Debretsion added. He also alleged that some federal soldiers had crossed the border into Eritrea on Wednesday. “This shows their relations,” Debretsion said. --BBC--
