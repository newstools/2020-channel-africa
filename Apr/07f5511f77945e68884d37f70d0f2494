Some wealthy people are ignoring protocol by seeking private care instead of contacting the Centre for Disease Control, it says. Nigeria's health minister said that private facilities must be accredited to treat highly infectious disease. Officials have said the virus has spread in some states because of practitioners who continue to ignore those rules. They also say that secretly treating positive coronavirus cases could be dangerous for health staff and other patients. This is an issue that has been raised a few times during the daily presidential task-force briefings.
