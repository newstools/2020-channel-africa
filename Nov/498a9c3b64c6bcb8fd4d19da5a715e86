The court had charged Paul Gicheru and two others with obstructing the course of justice, accusing them of interfering with the prosecutors' witnesses in the case against alleged organisers and funders of post-election violence in 2007. More than 1000 people were killed, 900 acts of rape and sexual violence were documented, and approximately 350 000 people were displaced, Kenyan news site The Star reports. The ICC accuses Gicheru and others of operating a scheme to approach witnesses, corrupt them, and get them to withdraw from the cases. Gicheru has not commented. Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta and his Deputy William Ruto were among six people indicted by the ICC for their role in the violence. After years in court the ICC prosecutor dropped the cases against Kenyatta in 2015, and Â Ruto a year later, blaming witness interference. --BBC--
