Tennis has been on an enforced hiatus since the start of March due to the coronavirus pandemic, leaving players whose livelihoods depend on prize money without an income. The ITF, ATP, WTA and the four Grand Slam bodies have already launched a $6 million Player Relief Programme that will help about 800 lower-ranked singles and doubles players affected by Covid-19. And now the ITF will give further support to tour players ranked between 501 and 700 who are "not covered under other relief programmes". "We are doing everything within our power to ensure that the talented players climbing the ITF pathway receive the support they need and continue their development during these uncertain times," ITF President, David Haggerty, said in a statement. "Many professionals and organisations in the tennis world have been significantly impacted by this hiatus in our sport due to Covid-19. It's not a simple blanket approach and this takes time. The ITF is reviewing all feasible and appropriate options to provide support where it is most needed amongst our different stakeholders." --News24--
