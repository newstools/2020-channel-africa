Djokovic resumed training on Tuesday and said he would take part in clay events.

"I still do not know if I will play the US Open," the tennis world No 1 said in an interview with the Sportski Zurnal daily paper.

"I will certainly not play Washington or Cincinnati as planned."

The Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) and Women's Tennis Associations tours are set to resume in August 2020, even though several professional players have contracted Covid-19.

The US Open will be the first Grand Slam following the restart, due to get underway behind closed doors in New York on August 31.

"Participation at Roland Garros is certain for now, Madrid and Rome are part of my agenda," he said.

The Serbian said he thought the ATP's revised ranking system, due to be introduced in August, was "correct".

Djokovic said on July 2 that he and his wife Jelena had both tested negative for coronavirus after testing positive during the Adria Tour in late June.

The couple had been self-isolating since returning to Belgrade from Croatia, where the second leg of his ill-fated tournament was held.
