World No 3, Federer, is set to be out of action for about four months after undergoing knee surgery earlier in February, but he is expected to return in mid-June for the grass-court season. If all goes according to plan, he should be fighting fit by the time the Laver Cup comes around in September. This year's tournament will be hosted in the United States with the TD Garden in Boston getting the honours. The 20-time Grand Slam winner has represented Team Europe in the first three editions with Bjorn Borg's outfit winning all three tournaments. "I've never been to Boston and I'm really looking forward to seeing some of the sights and playing tennis in front of their great fans," Federer said. "The Laver Cup is like nothing else in world tennis and I'm sure playing in a city that loves its sport as much as Boston does, the atmosphere is going to be unreal. Each year gets tougher for Team Europe to hold back Team World, and Boston will be a whole new ball game." --News24--
