Ghana’s opposition leader, John Mahama, has expressed concern over alleged use of the military to intimidate and attack his supporters in some parts of the country. The government has denied the allegations. Collation of results is still ongoing following Monday's general election. More than 17 million people were eligible to vote for a new parliament and president. Although the two main parties are claiming victory in the election, provisional results put the incumbent, President Nana Akufo Addo, ahead in the presidential race. Ghana’s electoral commission reneged on an initial promise to release official results 24 hours after voting ended, saying it needed to more time to ensure accuracy. --BBC--
