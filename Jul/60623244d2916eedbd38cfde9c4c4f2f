The opposition accuses Malonda, currently Ceni's Secretary-General, of playing a role in rigging previous elections in favour of former President Joseph Kabila. The country's parliament is dominated by Kabila's supporters. The protests, which were also about proposed judicial reforms, were led by the main opposition Lamuka coalition. The renewed protests came just days after at least three people were killed during last week's demonstrations against the choice of the electoral chairman. --BBC--
