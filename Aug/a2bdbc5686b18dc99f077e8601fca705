Usuthu entered the enforced break, as a result of the coronavirus, in 15th place on the league standings with 23 points from 24 games, just three from bottom-side Black Leopards. In their final six games, Dlamini's side face Baroka, Bidvest Wits, Bloemfontein Celtic, Black Leopards, Stellenbosch and Highlands Park. Only 11 points separates the nine teams in the lower half of the league, meaning a strong end to the season could technically see AmaZulu end as high as eighth. Speaking to the club's official website, Dlamini explained: "It will be a big challenge. Mentally for the players and so we are trying to work on that. The response from the players is very positive. It's very different to train now because we know when we are starting the games compared to when we didn't know.” "Now we have some direction. The attitude has been very good from the boys and it helps that we are going to resume the league. I think it's more about the mentality now and the desire to work hard.” he added. "There will be tactics involved but I think for these six games remaining, it will be about who wants it more than the other, the fight that you put out on the field that counts." --News24--
