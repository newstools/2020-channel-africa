Joseph Thige says he was pressured by his family to come home because they feared he was at risk of contracting the dangerous coronavirus. "I did not want to leave, as I was assisting in logistics and my family demanded and required that I leave," he said. But he says that his work is not done and he wants to help those he has left behind. Thige, who studies at the Jiangsu University in Zhenjiang City, says he came back home via a connecting flight in Thailand. He said that while some Kenyans had decided to stay in China, they were only surviving, barely able to meet their needs. "The problem is that once you get out of the university, the rules bar you from going back," he told the BBC. This is a problem for students on scholarship, who worry they will not be able to complete their courses. Kenya's government ruled out evacuating Kenyans from China weeks ago, though it recently said it was providing $13 000 to support them. Acting health director-general Patrick Amoth said he was aware that some Kenyans were leaving China on their own. Everyone travelling from China was required to self-isolate for 14 days even if they did not show any symptoms of the virus, he added. Thige is currently resting at home but has asked people not to stigmatise Kenyans returning to the country as "they have been through a lot of trauma with the restricted movement" in China.
