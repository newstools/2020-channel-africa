The health ministry says the fatalities have been recorded in the northern part of the country. More than 500 cases of cholera have been reported. The outbreak started in Garissa and spread to Wajir, Turkana, Muranga, Marsabit counties. Minister Mutahi Kagwe attributed the outbreak to flooding that led to poor sanitation as pit latrines contaminated all water points. Kagwe, in a video shared by local television NTV, said children were most affected by the disease. --BBC--
