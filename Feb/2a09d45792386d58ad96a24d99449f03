Nadal is the King of Roland Garros as he won a 12th French Open last year, double the amount of next best man Bjorn Borgâ€™s previous Open Era record in Paris. The Spaniard will once again be the heavy favourite to win another trophy at the red dirt major, but former world No 1 Hewitt says Djokovic and Thiem are in with a shout. Djokovic, who won in Paris in 2016 and finished runner-up three times, secured his 17 Grand Slam title when he won the Australian Open last week, beating Thiem in the final at Melbourne Park. Thiem, meanwhile, has pedigree at Roland Garros as he was runner-up to Nadal in the last two editions. "Novak Djokovic can now absolutely win in Paris. You have got to throw in both the finalists from the Australian Open," Hewitt is quoted as saying by The Mirror. "Dominic Thiem is going to be a real threat at Roland Garros as well. "But Novak, the way that he moves and slides on clay, he has won there before, he is so strong over five sets, he is always going to be a threat. "You would have to say right now the two [Australian Open] finalists and Rafael Nadal are the three favourites for Roland Garros."
