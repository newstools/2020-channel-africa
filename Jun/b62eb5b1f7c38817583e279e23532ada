It is a lead South African rugby, especially the many pockets that protect symbols of prejudice, needs to follow, post-haste.

Last week, reports emerged the English Rugby Football Union (RFU) was looking into whether Swing Low, Sweet Chariot, sung by its fans before Twickenham Tests, bears racist tones.

Prompted by the ever-growing Black Lives Matter movement, the RFU is investigating the appropriateness of the song being sung by fans at its iconic home stadium for the past three decades.

The song has its roots during the slave trade - a "Negro spiritual" folk song - and, according to Wooster College professor of music and black studies Josephine Wright, belonged to a category of songs called an "alerting song".

The singing of the song at Twickenham, according to British newspaper reports, began as a cheer when black England players Martin "Chariots" Offiah and Chris Oti scored in the 1980s.

The RFU does not know whether well-meaning fans meant to sing it as a form of endearment towards the two rugby players or that they were being singled out for the colour of their skin. Rightly, they have taken the microscope and turned it inwards.

The same can be said of the Crusaders, the southern hemisphere's most prolific and successful rugby club.Â 

After a gunman went on a murderous rampage, killing 51 people in two Christchurch mosques in 2019, they replaced their knight and sword logo with a Maori motif.
