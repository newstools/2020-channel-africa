This comes after President FÃ©lix Tshisekedi had appealed to the Cooperative for the Development of Congo (Codeco) to stop violence, the agency reports. "We are stopping the acts of violence as the head of state is asking. We are ready to seize his outstretched hand. That's why we are telling our units to respect this process, to be calm," the group's spokesman Basa Zukpa is quoted as saying. The spokesperson did not say when the ceasefire was agreed. The president had sent a group of former warlords in Ituri province to convince Codeco to stop attacks. Police in the region say violence has decreased since the ceasefire. Codeco has been the main armed group active in the region since 2017 and is mainly drawn from the Lendu community. --BBC--
