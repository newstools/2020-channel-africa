Two journalists from the Oromia News Network and three members of the opposition Oromo Liberation Front were arrested nearly a month ago for allegedly taking photos in a police station in the country's largest administrative state, Oromia. Ethiopia has announced the release of more than 10 000 inmates to avoid prison overcrowding as part of measures taken to curb the coronavirus pandemic. The government has also closed some courts to try and stop the spread of the virus. As a result the cases against the five were dropped and authorities were told last week to secure their release, but this has not been done yet. --BBC--
