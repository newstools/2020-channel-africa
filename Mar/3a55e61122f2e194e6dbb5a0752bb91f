BA is cancelling 216 flights from 16-28 March from London to destinations including New York, Italy, France, Austria, Belgium, Germany and Ireland. Ryanair will cut up to 25% of flights in and out of Italy from March 17 to April 8. Tourists and business people are cutting back on foreign travel. There could be a "very significant expansion" of the number of cases of coronavirus in the United Kingdom, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has warned. "Our focus at this time is on minimising any risk to our people and our passengers”, Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary said. "While we are heavily booked over the next two weeks, there has been a notable drop in forward bookings towards the end of March, into early April. It makes sense to selectively prune our schedule to and from those airports where travel has been most affected by the Covid-19 outbreak." The firm declined to say how many flights or passengers would be affected. However, it said the move would not affect its results for the financial year which ends on March 31. BA said it would contact customers on cancelled flights to offer rebooking on to other carriers, refunds or another flight with BA for a later date of travel. --BBC--
