The plant operates on a "just in time" production system, where parts arrive at the factory when they are needed. Honda has told employees that it is currently experiencing vessel delays and congestion at United Kingdom (UK) ports. It will pause production on Wednesday "due to transport-related parts delay", the car giant said. "The situation is currently being monitored with a view to restart production as soon as possible," Honda said. It is looking at other arrangements such as air freight. Congestion at UK container ports has been building up in recent weeks, causing problems initially at Felixstowe, but recently at Southampton and London Gateway as well.

The backlog has built up as companies increased orders after the initial pandemic lockdown, while some have looked to stockpile goods before the end of the Brexit transition period.
