Libya was plunged into chaos after the toppling and killing of former leader, Muammar Gaddafi, in a 2011 NATO-backed uprising. Since 2014, it has been split into rival eastern and western administrations. Tensions escalated in April 2019 when renegade commander Khalifa Haftar, who backs the eastern government, launched an offensive to capture the capital, Tripoli, the seat of the Government of National Accord (GNA).  
 
He also urged the international community, and particularly the United Nations Security Council, to fulfill their responsibilities for achieving peace and stability in Libya, according to Algeria's APS news agency. Tebboune said that since the beginning of the Libyan crisis, Algeria has adopted the principle of "finding a political solution to protect the unity of the Libyan people and the territorial integrity of the country without foreign intervention". The meeting came before a separate visit to Algeria by Turkish Foreign Minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, whose country has sent military units to Libya to back al-Sarraj's government. The GNA has recently sought help from Turkey, whose parliament passed a bill allowing the government to send troops to Libya to shore up the Tripoli government in line with an agreement between the two sides. On Saturday, Libya's eastern-based parliament voted unanimously against the deals the Tripoli-based government signed with Ankara in late November.
