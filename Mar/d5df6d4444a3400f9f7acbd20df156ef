Maixent Raoul Ominga, director general of state-owned SNPC, said lawyers for DRC were working with representatives of Glencore and Trafigura to get all the parties talking. Glencore and Trafigura declined to comment. “The government’s objective is to have an agreement with them before the next IMF review in April,” Ominga told Reuters in Paris, in the first public comments by a Congolese official on the efforts to get agreement. Sources told Reuters in January talks between DRC and the Swiss energy traders had broken down after the firms rejected a haircut on the debt. The IMF agreed a $449 million, three-year lending programme in July – but only $45 million has been disbursed with other funds subject to semi-annual reviews. A requirement for further disbursements is the restructuring of DRC’s oil-backed loans from the Swiss traders. If they agree to a haircut, or accepting lower than market value for the assets that are collateral for the loans, DRC would spend less on debt servicing. The IMF has said it delayed submitting a 2019 year-end review to its executive board as it waits for Congo Republic to finalise a deal with the traders. Ominga told Reuters the situation escalated in February when Glencore tried to recover its funds and sought to prevent the delivery of some DRC crude cargoes. Had Glencore succeeded, he said that would have blocked negotiations and paralysed the central African country, which is heavily indebted.
