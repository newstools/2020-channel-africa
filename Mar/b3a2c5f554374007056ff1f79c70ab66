They will be shut from Wednesday for 30 days, Prime Minister, Kassim Majaliwa said. All public gatherings, including sports events, were also to be suspended, he said. The measures come a day after a 46-year-old Tanzanian, who arrived in the country on Sunday from Belgium, tested positive for Covid-19. Several individuals who came into contact with the first patient had been tracked down and quarantined, Majaliwa said. A search for others was ongoing, he said. The country was well prepared to manage Covid-19 if it continued to spread in the country, he added. --BBC--
