At least four people died in the accident that happened late on Tuesday off the northern coast of the island of Lanzarote. The Spanish authorities say 28 people have been rescued so far and a search operation is continuing. The past months have seen increasing numbers of migrants trying to reach the Canaries, the European Union territory nearest to northwest Africa.
