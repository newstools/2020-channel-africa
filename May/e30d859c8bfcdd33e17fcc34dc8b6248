In a light-hearted conversation with Siya Kolisi - Pietersen was hosting an Instagram Live chat with the Springbok captain on Monday - the man known as 'KP' was put on the spot! Pietersen left South Africa in 2000 and would go on to become one of England's greatest ever batsmen. In comical fashion, Pietersen stated in his chat with Kolisi that he was always a winner when the Springboks and England met. "When England play South Africa, whoever wins, I support. I'm allowed to," he said to laughter from Kolisi. "I was born in South Africa and I lived there for 20 years and I've lived in the UK now for 20 years, so whoever wins, I win." Kolisi, though, was not accepting 'KP' sitting on the fence and went in to bat for the Springboks. "Who do you support ... before the game?" Kolisi probed. "I'll WhatsApp you after! I don't want to cause chaos!" was Pietersen's reply. Eventually, Pietersen buckled. "If the Springboks are playing, I want the Springboks to win, end of story," he said. "Against anyone?" Kolisi then probed further. "Against anyone," Pietersen responded. "Cricket is a different thing. That was my job and who I played for and that's who gave me the most unbelievable opportunities in life. "My passion for Springbok rugby and watching the Springboks in 1995 in the Rugby World Cup ... it is what it is. You can't change who I was for 19, 20 years because I went and plied my trade somewhere else." Kolisi, having banked another Springbok supporter, then let Pietersen off the hook. "The people are happy back at home," he said.
