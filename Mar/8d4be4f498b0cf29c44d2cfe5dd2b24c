The Social Democrat and Green coalition said that Sweden would contribute a rapid reaction force of up to 150 troops and helicopters as part of international efforts to boost security in the region. “That, in its turn, will make it easier to carry out development activities in Mali which are needed to promote a sustainable and peaceful development in the country,” Foreign Minister, Ann Linde, said in a statement. “The decision will also mean we can contribute to the fight against international terrorism and ultimately also make Sweden safer and more secure.” Parliament has to approve the government’s decision. --Reuters--
