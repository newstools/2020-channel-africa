SAA entered business rescue, a local form of bankruptcy protection, in December, after which administrators took over the running of the airline and have been working on a plan to save the business. The draft plan said the government had agreed to make a working capital injection, which the administrators estimated at not less than R2 billion ($114.86 million), fund employee layoffs, which could cost up to $114.86 million, and make an allocation of at least R600 million ($34.4 million) towards the repayment of general concurrent creditors. A spokesperson for the administrators confirmed the draft plan was genuine. ($1 = R17.41) --Reuters--
