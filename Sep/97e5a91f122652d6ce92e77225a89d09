The men are accused of cloning the website of a company in Holland, ILBN Holdings BV, and defrauding Freiherr Fredrick Von Hahna, a representative of the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia. The suspects identified by police as Babatunde Adesanya, also known as Teddy, and Akinpelu Hassan Abass have not yet appeared in court. Von Hahna paid $2.8 million for the supply of PPE and when the goods did not arrive he went to the company's offices only to learn that it never did any business with him and he had been conned, police said. Police in Holland arrested two suspects there, and investigations extended to Nigeria, where a further two suspects were arrested, Nigerian police added.  --BBC--
