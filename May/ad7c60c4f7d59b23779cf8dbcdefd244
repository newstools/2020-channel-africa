In a meeting of top Ethiopian government and military personnel on Monday, chaired by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, officials reiterated Ethiopia’s intention to start filling the reservoir in July, with or without an agreement. The construction of the $4bn Grand Ethiopia Renaissance Dam, in the west of the country, is about 75% complete, and is set to be Africa’s largest hydropower project. The dam has been at the centre of a row between Ethiopia and Egypt from the very beginning, with Sudan caught in between. Despite long-running negotiations, efforts to reach an amicable deal between two countries and Sudan have failed. Egypt, which relies on the Nile for 90% of its water, fears Ethiopia will have an unrestrained control over the water supply. It has expressed concern over the rate Ethiopia would fill the dam’s reservoir, and how much water would flow downstream. Ethiopia expects the dam to boost its electricity production, but Egypt fears the dam will hinder the water supply for communities alongside the Nile who rely on it for survival. --BBC--
