"During this morning's training session, Dembele felt some discomfort in his right leg as a consequence of muscle fatigue," Barcelona said in a statement. "He will continue with his rehabilitation." Dembele has not played for Barca since November 27 but had been expected to return this month. The 22-year-old has endured a spate of injuries since moving to Camp Nou from Borussia Dortmund in 2017 and has only made nine appearances this term.
