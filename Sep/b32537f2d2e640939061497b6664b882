Anxious Masuka, the Agriculture Minister, under regulations published in a government gazette said three types of permits can be issued for growers, researchers and industrial hemp merchants. Growers are only allowed to cultivate, market and sell industrial hemp and researchers may cultivate for research purposes. A merchant can contract individual farmers, procure and process industrial hemp into a specified product. Prior to the new rule people found growing cannabis in Zimbabwe were liable to a jail term of up to 12-years.  --Bloomberg--
