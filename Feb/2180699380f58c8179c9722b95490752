Nissan’s sharply waning earnings power has already prompted plans to slash jobs, close manufacturing sites and drop product offerings as the automaker steps back from an aggressive pursuit of market share championed by Ghosn. The dismal outlook comes after the automaker posted a net loss of $238 million for the October-December third quarter, and contrasts with upbeat forecasts from rivals Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Co. “We are making progress, but sales volumes have been weak so we need to do more restructuring than initially planned,” Makoto Uchida, Nissan's new Chief Executive Officer and its third since September, told reporters. Japan’s number two automaker now expects operating income of $775 million for March 2020. Its brand image hurt badly by years of heavy discounting in the United States and other countries, Nissan’s global vehicle sales tumbled 11% during the October-December 2019 period, Sales dropped 18% in the United States (US), with once popular models like its Rogue SUV crossover and its Sentra sedan falling out of favour.
