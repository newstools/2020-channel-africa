Chicago-based United is among the United States (US) airlines that have accepted US government payroll aid that bans job or pay cuts before September 30. However, United and other carriers have warned that demand is unlikely to recover to pre-crisis levels by that date, forcing them to shrink in the fall. The United memos are the first indication of just how much major airlines might downsize due to the health crisis. “We have to acknowledge that there will be serious consequences to our company if we don’t continue to take strong and decisive action, which includes making decisions that none of us ever wanted or expected to make,” Kate Gebo, Executive Vice President Human Resources and Labour Relations, said in the memo to some 11.500 management and administrative employees. Affected employees will be notified in mid to late July for an October 1 effective date, she said, while encouraging employees to consider a voluntary separation before that date. In a separate memo seen by Reuters, pilots were told to prepare for a “displacement” that will affect roughly 30% of roughly 12.250 pilots. One pilot union official said the group was interpreting the message to mean a 30% reduction as soon as October1. United sent memos on Monday to a number of work groups about near-term changes and potential long-term implications, spokesperson Leslie Scott said. --Reuters--
