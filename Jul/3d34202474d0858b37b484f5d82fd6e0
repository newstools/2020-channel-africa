While the signs are largely positive, it is still not clear when South Africa's professional rugby franchises will return to the field. On June 25, Mthethwa announced that contact sports would be allowed to return to training, but those plans needed to be officially gazetted by government and that has now happened. In a statement sent out on Monday, Mthethwa laid out the conditions for how contact sports could be phased back. While the document should also apply to football's desired return, government seems to have dealt with that code individually and some Premier Soccer League clubs are back training already. Rugby, though, has found itself a step behind. In the statement, Mthethwa confirmed that clubs, franchises or associations now have 14 days to submit their comprehensive proposals on how they will safely return to training. Government will then have seven days to examine the proposal and make a decision before giving final approval. --News24--
